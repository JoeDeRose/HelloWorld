    Anthony originally wanted to put a silver high-heel shoe on top of the car, à la <em>Priscilla</em>
    - but by the day of the trip it was clear that we lacked the time and mechanical knowledge
    to make it happen. In a profound temptation of fate, I mailed the last payment on the car
    note the afternoon of the day we left.</td>

    had hoped to enter an underwear contest that never got organized and where I flirted
    endlessly with the upstairs bartender)</em> and Parade <em>(where we watched a pretty cool
    drag show)</em>. Before leaving New Orleans the next morning, I wanted to show Anthony one
    of my favorite restaurants in the world:&nbsp; Café du Monde, a 24-hour eatery that is
    internationally famous for delicious beignets (square doughnuts without holes, and topped
    with powdered sugar). Anthony thought he would be able to indulge my obsession for the
    things, and could get a different breakfast item for himself, but discovered when we got
    there that the only items on the menu are (1) beignets, (2) cokes, (3) chicory coffee, and
    (4) milk. He finally turned to me and said, &quot;I should have mentioned this, but I <em>hate</em>
    doughnuts.&quot; We took a quick tour past the mansions and streetcar line of St Charles
    Avenue, and then headed farther west than either of us had ever driven before.</td>

    their September mating ritual. which takes place at about windshield level <em>(because

    two more lanes in each direction on serpentine bridges above. The signs only indicated
    &quot;I-10 West Upper&quot; and &quot;I-10 West Lower&quot;; it seemed like an important

    we saw, just east of the town of <strong>Junction</strong>. It was a Best Western, and at
    $55/night seemed a bit high <em>(although, by the end of the trip, I would have jumped at
    it)</em>. When I said I would keep looking, the hotel clerk told me that he could rent me
    a room in the hotel next door <em>(Red Flag #1)</em>. He said the Best Western was
    permitted to rent out the best room in that hotel <em>(Red Flag #2)</em> for $35/night <em>(Red
    Flag #3)</em> because the owner of that hotel stayed at the Best Western <em>(Big Red Flag
    #4)</em> insofar as he refused to sleep in his own establishment <em>(Huge, Huge Red Flag
    #5)</em>. My senses dulled from the long Texas drive, I said okay. At first we thought it
    was cool that there was a traveling circus parked outside the room. Then, after about 20
    seconds, we noticed the fleas with which the room was infested. To add insult to injury,
    the bath mat was a piece of 11&quot;x17&quot; cardstock with fish printed on it. Having
    arrived there in the middle of the night, Anthony and I were convinced that we must have
    driven far enough to be in the desert, finally. We were disappointed to wake up and see
    scrubby bushes covering the landscape.<p><font color="#800080"><em>Highway Markers:</em></font>

    (after the rain ended), but got afraid of space aliens and kept driving. This was the
    darkest night I have ever seen. It was also our only experience with the Llano Estacado,

    that the Spanish explorers had to drive stakes into the earth in order to find their way
