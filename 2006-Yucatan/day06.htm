<p>Every moment of every day is an opportunity for learning.&nbsp; And one of 
the many things&nbsp; I 
learned on this day was:&nbsp; When you get off the beaten path, the path beats back.&nbsp; 
This was the day we reported for a much-anticipated event  the Aktun Tunichil 
Muknal cave hike, known in short as &quot;ATM.&quot;.</p>

<p>First let me say that spelunking is not going to be 
my sport:&nbsp; This is an activity that I am thrilled to <i>have done</i>.&nbsp; 
But it was not an activity that I was thrilled to <i>be doing</i>.&nbsp; That 
said, ATM was spectacular.&nbsp; It had been known to local farmers and 
the chicle harvesters that frequented a certain sapodilla tree for some time, but was only revealed  in 1989  to archaeologists.&nbsp; 
Nine years later a tour policy was established that now grants two tour agencies  permission to lead in 
visitors under very 
specific restrictions.&nbsp; It is almost universally believed that the Belize 
Department of Archaeology will soon clap a gate on the entrance to this cave, as they 
have done on others, allowing entry only to archaeologists researching the site.&nbsp; 
We are lucky that our trip  coincided with the window in which the 
general public is allowed to see these astonishing relics.</p>

<p>It's not easy to get to, though:&nbsp; Our tour 
started at Eva's Restaurant, from which we departed on the first leg of the trip 
in:&nbsp; an hour's drive with with ten other visitors and two guides.&nbsp; 
Five of us were with Francisco, and seven others were with Patrick  but until 
we were in the cave we pretty much stayed together as one group.</p>

<p>Our van crossed rivers a 
few times on bridges, and twice without the benefit of bridges.&nbsp; The first of these 
through-the-river crossings was  what I think was the Eastern 
Branch Macal River, and was on a submerged concrete dam (of a type that I have 
also seen occasionally for crossings in the U.S., albeit in places where the 
water flow was much lower than here).&nbsp; The second crossing may have been 
over Roaring Creek, with which we would become intimately familiar over the 
long day, and was completely undeveloped:&nbsp; The van just plunged itself 
slowly into the current and nudged its way across.&nbsp; We stopped for approval 
at the ranger's station (which was also his home).&nbsp; Then we parked and hiked 
forty-five minutes through the jungle, trudging 
across Roaring Creek three times as we followed the path that had been preserved 
from among the old Maya routes.&nbsp; Patrick led the way, using his machete to 
hack away any plants that had grown across the path in the last day.&nbsp; 
(Which led me to wonder how much traffic these old Maya paths get, that they are 
still in existence though they require this much effort to maintain.)&nbsp; 
Francisco kept the rear, hacking more enthusiastically to facilitate travels for 
others coming behind us and for us on the return.&nbsp; As hard as this trek was 
for me, I have to give proper recognition to Patrick and Francisco.&nbsp; Not 
only did they do the same thing we were doing  but they did it while hauling 
heavy packs that included their supplies, emergency items, and some of our supplies.&nbsp; 
That latter fact, by the way, explains the paucity of pictures on this page:&nbsp; Because of 
the risk of damage, our cameras were locked in &quot;wet bags&quot; carried by the guides, 
to protect them as were were making our way across, and up, the creek.&nbsp; At 
important junctures, Francisco would retrieve the cameras for us  but this was 
too involved a process for him to do it at every interesting thing along the 
way.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/day06/HK.gif" align="right" hspace="5" width="100" height="85">On the 
hike, our guides introduced us a bit 
to the local flora and fauna:&nbsp; On thing was saw as was an enormous termite nest  on the side of 
a nearby tree at chest level.&nbsp; We were told that the termites were edible, 
but didn't get a sample; I 
know that some tours actually let hikers taste the termites  but, 
unfortunately, either the practice has stopped or our guides skipped that event.&nbsp; 
We were warned against straying from the path or touching any plants, because 
&quot;some of them make poison ivy seem like a rose.&quot;&nbsp; A highlight was 
collecting a couple of cohune nuts just before one river crossing, and having 
Francisco smash them on a rock at the other side of the river, allowing us to 
eat the coconut-like interior.&nbsp; Patrick also showed us a cacao tree (&quot;we send you this seed, and you send us back little Kisses with 
almonds in them&quot;) and the sapodilla tree, with its diagonal slashes, that had 
been responsible for the rediscovery of this cave.</p>

<p>At the end of the jungle portion of the hike, we enjoyed a tremendously 
generous lunch that we had hauled in with us, and availed ourselves of the last 
opportunity to use a toilet without carrying out our produce  in a baggy.&nbsp; 
(They're really serious about protecting this cave.)&nbsp; Unfortunately, the 
toilet was a wooden plank with a square hole carved in it, completely open to 
the view of others who might come looking for it in the woods.&nbsp; Fortunately, I 
did not find that I required its services.</p>

<p><font color="#880000">Finally we donned our helmets and miner's lights and plunged ourselves into the 
cave from which Roaring Creek spills.&nbsp; The Maya know their underworld as 
Xibalba, and their ancestors clearly had a great reverence for this cave, 
considering the ceremonial and sacrificial items that have been found in it.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">Our hike inside the cave involved two hours of 
immersion in chilly water, sometimes to our knees, other times over our heads, 
that took us about a mile into the underworld.&nbsp; We slogged on, wearing just our bathing suits and our shoes, 
fighting our way through strong currents, hauling ourselves up jagged 
waterfalls, and ducking under low overhangs, all with no more illumination than 
our LED miner's lights could afford (which, in fairness, was actually decent 
illumination).&nbsp; In case you have not had a chance for empirical research in 
this arena, I can report that swimming in shoes is more difficult than it would 
seem  but the shoes 
were a blessing against the rocks at the bottom that we pushed ourselves against for most of 
the route.&nbsp; We were told that we might see cave spiders as big as our 
outspread hands, and that we should not fear them, even though they did bite and 
were poisonous (but not lethal), because they were blind and would not jump at 
us.&nbsp; I tried not to fear them  a task that 
was made easier by the fact that we did not encounter them.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">To get to the dry section where the 
artifacts lay we climbed a rock and squirmed across and over an eight-foot drop 
to an overhanging ledge. This was just as horrifying as it sounds, more so 
because of the distance and effort that separated us from resources for medical 
care.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for this portion of the route our cameras were locked 
in the wet bag, so I cannot show you how unnerving it was.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">Here 
we removed our waterlogged shoes, as  to preserve the relics  the dry chambers 
may be explored only in sock feet.&nbsp; Here I can report further that, while 
swimming in shoes may be uncomfortable, walking in a cave without them is even 
more so.&nbsp; Anyway, this is how it must be done, so this is how we did it.&nbsp; 
Shoeless, we climbed up a steep incline which elevated us another ten feet or 
so, and then were given our education on how to walk in the cave and why:&nbsp; 
The cave has not been disturbed and never will be, so they will not investigate 
any pools of water to see what they contain.&nbsp; But they assume that some of 
the shallow pools must contain pottery fragments of some sort; thus, to ensure 
that these are not ruined by tourism, we were not to place our feet in the water at 
any time.&nbsp; We could only step in places where it was visually obvious that 
we weren't stepping on anything historic; we were to move slowly, so we didn't 
lose our balance and fall into a pot or a skeleton; we were to walk on the natural dams that the sedimentary process 
has left adjacent to the pools; we were to follow our guide's 
instructions without fail as to where and when we may step.&nbsp; I came to 
believe that Francisco was prepared to kill me on the spot if it appeared I was 
about to blunder into an artifact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">There were inevitable missteps, but we were all careful and nothing was 
broken.&nbsp; This owed mostly to our obedience and intelligence, but some luck 
came into play as well, and I found myself thinking that limiting visits to 
archaeologists might actually not be such a bad idea.&nbsp; Francisco showed us 
some examples of pots broken by tour groups, and I was thankful by the end that 
we hadn't been responsible for any such desecration.&nbsp; Anyway, with our 
education in place, we were ready for the heart of the visit.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">Now my experience of going in caves is extremely 
limited  off the top of my head I can name only  three:&nbsp;  Ruby 
Falls, the Lost Sea, and Carlsbad Caverns (and all of those can be visited by 
people in wheelchairs!).&nbsp; I knew that this would be a different experience, 
but one thing took me by surprise:&nbsp; One thing in common about those other 
caves I've visited is that the stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and formations 
are the &quot;money shots&quot; of the cave, and are vigorously protected.&nbsp; They are 
also, in many cases, decorated with lights and names that lean substantially 
toward cheesy.&nbsp; This cave was not about all that.&nbsp; We pulled ourselves 
along by stalactites when necessary, and were rarely asked not to touch a 
natural formation.&nbsp; Only once did Francisco shine his flashlight at a cave 
feature and say &quot;nativity scene&quot;  and on that occasion it really did look like 
a nativity scene (I thought it even before he said it).&nbsp; No, the reason 
were were in this cave was archaeology, not geology  but that is not to say the 
natural features were anything less than stunning:&nbsp; Some of the petrified flows 
along walls in 
the cave were absolutely breathtaking, more amazing than any I had seen before.&nbsp; 
And the water seepage was not the dripping from a stalactite that one ordinarily 
sees; rather, it was in some places a torrent spilling from overhead with about 
the force of a typical household shower.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">But, again, we were there for the Maya, not for Xibalba.&nbsp; 
So first we were led to an area where some pottery fragments lay on the floor of 
the cave.&nbsp; Not knowing what was ahead, we marveled at these; any museum 
would make them a centerpiece, but they paled against what came later.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">Then Franscisco showed us a tableau that is, indeed, 
one of the major finds in the cave.&nbsp; It is believed to be an altar of sorts 
 arranged ceremonially.&nbsp; Specifically, the archaeologists believe that the 
arrangement of the pots is highly significant.&nbsp; Little of this was 
explained in detail, and much of it would go over my head  but, in part, the 
upright pots were to evoke &quot;filling&quot; (which they sometimes did under the drip of 
stalactites), the tilted ones were to evoke &quot;spilling,&quot; and the upturned ones 
were to evoke &quot;emptying.&quot;&nbsp; Another example was a formation that appeared 
much like the Maya goddess Ix Chel; the archaeologists are uncertain whether this is a purely 
natural formation or one that has been modified artificially  but they aver 
that the Maya considered this spot sacred because of that particular formation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">We saw fire pits where the charcoal blocks they used 
were still visible after centuries.&nbsp; And Francisco told us that this was 
the place where the Maya royalty would come to burn their incense (a corn

destruction were used:&nbsp; shattering, breaking (removing a piece), chipping 
(removing a layer from the surface), and drilling.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">The first part of the dry area has not been so bad to 
walk on because of the flat sedimentary flow.&nbsp; But as we went back further, 
the rocks became rougher and the passages became tighter.&nbsp; At one point we 
had to climb a ladder (the only modern artificial item we saw in our entire 
walk) up to a higher level.&nbsp; (I am at pains  literally  to describe which 
is more uncomfortable:&nbsp; ladders in socks, or swimming in shoes.)&nbsp; This 
was worth the misery, though:&nbsp; At the top of the ladder, and back a short 
distance across a small opening was the woman's skeleton lying in the chamber  
the &quot;stone sepulcher&quot;  from which the cave takes its name.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">At this point, all we had to do was the return:&nbsp; 
We made our way back down the ladder, back past the skeletons, back past the 
pottery, back to our shoes.&nbsp; Our cameras were locked in the wet bags.&nbsp; 
Our shoes were back on our feet.&nbsp; We slid down the incline to the precipice 
(over the frightening eight-foot drop) and strained to reach the pointy rock 
below with our toes.&nbsp; All of our group made it without injury and we 
plunged ourselves back into Roaring Creek to follow its currents out of Xibalba.</font></p>

<p><font color="#880000">Getting out was much easier than getting in, mostly due 
to the fact that the current was helping us rather than working against us.&nbsp; 
In fact, the only times we had any trouble at all were when we had to clamber 
down waterfalls without going so fast that we might hurt ourselves.</font></p>

<p>We emerged from the cave to the picnic area near the sapodilla tree.&nbsp; 
Francisco offered to get out our cameras if we would like to take pictures on 
the route back.&nbsp; Having more familiarity with the river crossings, I felt 
certain I could keep my camera dry  but no one else was interested and 
Francisco remembered that my camera was at the bottom of the bag and recommended 
not worrying about it.&nbsp; He had been so generous in carrying our supplies as 
well as his own that I could hardly complain.</p>

<h1 align="center">Illness II</h1>

<p>It was probably just as well, anyway.&nbsp; I was showing early signs of some 
illness that manifested itself as  how to put this  discomfort and stupidity.&nbsp; 
At first I thought I was merely dehydrated, as I noticed I had only drunk half 
of the water I had brought in.&nbsp; This may have entered into it, but I feel 
certain there was more:&nbsp; Perhaps, there was some bacterium in the water.&nbsp; 
Perhaps I had brushed against the wrong plant or been bitten or stung by the 
wrong insect.&nbsp; Or perhaps it was not nearly so exotic; perhaps the wrong 
person had just sneezed above my food.&nbsp; In any event, I was mightily tired 
walking back  not such that I slowed us down, but enough that I really needed 
to stop when we got back to the van.&nbsp; There, after changing my clothes, I 
almost forgot my camera as I hung it on on a limb by a screen set up for changing 
clothes; this near-disaster was averted by Billy noticing the camera and 
bringing it to me.&nbsp; I tried to sleep on the van ride back, but the &quot;roads&quot; 
made this difficult.&nbsp; And when finally back at the Parrot Nest, I kept 
craving things that didn't seem to help much:&nbsp; a shower, then food, then a 
chance to lay down.&nbsp; With a splitting headache, I thought I was taking two 
ibuprofen, but I realized the next morning I had taken two allergy pills 
instead.&nbsp; Finally, I excused myself from dinner (reluctantly, as this was 
our only dinner at Parrot Nest, and dessert hadn't even been served), and went 
to lay in my bed.&nbsp; In tropical Belize, I wore long pants, a long-sleeve 
shirt, and covered myself with two blankets, and literally shivered myself to 
sleep.</p>

<p>In the night, though, my body righted itself and we were able to continue 
with only a little more rest than I ordinarily require.&nbsp; It could have been 
a lot worse.</p>
