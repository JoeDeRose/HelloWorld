<title>Yucatán 2006 - Ground Rush</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1 align="center">Ground Rush</h1>
<p>Everyone who knows me is aware that skydiving in 1996 was among my seminal 
experiences because it was a really cool, once-in-a-lifetime (I hope) 
experience.&nbsp; But scholars of my life (wherever they may be hiding) will 
note that it was also important because it introduced me to &quot;ground rush,&quot; both 
as a concept and as a 
vocabulary term.&nbsp; Skydivers enjoy the free fall – but to 
enjoy the sport a second time you have to keep focused on your altitude:&nbsp; 
For a long time, as the seconds go by like hours, the ground seems (and is) 
miles away.&nbsp; But you have to pull the chute while the ground seems like it 
is still tremendously distant, because if you wait until the ground <i>seems</i> 
close, you will – to put it gently – overshoot your target.&nbsp; In many arenas 
– not only skydiving – the transition from <i>comfortably remote</i> to <i>
alarmingly imminent</i> is instantaneous.&nbsp; &quot;Ground rush&quot; describes the 
realization that one has traversed the barrier.</p>
<p>I begin this report nine days before departure, as I realize the ground rush 
has begun.&nbsp; It was all so far away until a couple of weeks ago, and now it 
feels like tomorrow.&nbsp; And all of the obsessive advance planning I've done 
for months suddenly seems woefully inadequate:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Hotel:</b>&nbsp; Our first three nights are at the Rancho Sak-Ok in 
  Puerto Morelos.&nbsp; Rancho was hit hard by hurricane Wilma and is still 
  rebuilding.&nbsp; Just a few days ago, I got an e-mail from them saying that 
  power was intermittent, the big palapa was still being rebuilt, and they are 
  still removing the wreckage of a ship from the beach in front of the hotel.&nbsp; 
  They offered to let us cancel without penalty, but I curried the situation into 
  a two-for-one room deal; whether or not I am an idiot for keeping the 
  reservation remains to be seen.</li>
  <li><b>The Car:</b>&nbsp; All seems to be in order with the Fox car rental.&nbsp; 
  Their website still indicates that they have no restrictions on driving area 
  (making them a singular exception to the rule, and our only lifeline to a 
  travel itinerary that takes us across two national borders).&nbsp; Insurance 
  plagues me still:&nbsp; I can (and will) waive CDW and have my American 
  Express card cover it for the whole trip.&nbsp; I can purchase liability, 
  which will cover me in Mexico.&nbsp; At the Belize border I can purchase 
  liability that will cover me in Belize.&nbsp; But at the Guatemala border I 
  cannot purchase insurance and have ascertained that my personal liability does 
  not cover me – so in Guatemala I'll be flying without a net.</li>
  <li><b>The Country:</b>&nbsp; Spanish is my best foreign language.&nbsp; If I 
  can't reasonably conduct simple tourist business in Spanish, I'm a failure as 
  a linguist.&nbsp; But throughout the planning process I've had to ask 
  (repeatedly!), <font face="Times New Roman">«Lo siento, pero yo no puedo 
  entenderle. ¿Habla Ud. Inglés?»&nbsp; This does not bode well.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I've pulled the ripcord.&nbsp; Now all I can do 
is wait to see how far away the ground is.</font></p>

<p>By the way, for the navigation bar I am using the Maya symbol for &quot;west&quot; as the 
icon for the previous page (as west is the direction associated with the origin 
of life).&nbsp; For the subsequent page, I am using &quot;east&quot; (as the 
opposite of west).&nbsp; For the main page, 
I used the glyph for &quot;center.&quot;&nbsp; I don't know if this is how the ancient 
Maya would have designed a Web page, but one does one's best.</p>
