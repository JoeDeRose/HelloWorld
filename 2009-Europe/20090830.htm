Billy and I had breakfast on the Vita Nova, and then went immediately to the 
  <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Anne Frank House");LangBoxJ("NL", "Anne Frank Huis");</script> along the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Prinsengracht");LangBoxJ("EN", "Prince&rsquo;s Canal");</script>. As promised, the line was both long and quick-moving, and we were inside
  within half an hour. And it was actually a very pleasant half-hour, as we made
    the acquaintance of a Briton and her teenage daughter, with whom we discussed
    our travel histories and aspirations. (The mother confessed that one of her
    more embarrassing experiences was during a tour of the Grand Canyon, when
  she asked when they would get to the area with the president&rsquo;s heads.) </p>
<p>The house is remembered, and named, for its its most
  famous resident &ndash; but it is really a testament to her father, Otto Frank,
  who was <span class="dropnote">cunning and shrewd</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> enough
  to get his family out of Germany at the start of the Nazi rise there, and then
  to protect them for most of the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.</p>

					  harass the victim, and then to belittle the same victim&rsquo;s

<p>But Otto&rsquo;s logistical skills were apparently equaled by his people skills.
  Over the years of running two companies, Opekta (a gelling product) and Pectacon
  (spicing products), Otto earned the love and trust of his employees, four of
  whom felt enough of a bond that they agreed to his request (apparently even
  without hesitation) that they risk their lives to shelter him and his family
  from the Nazi advance.</p>
<p>With those commitments in hand, Otto transferred ownership of his companies
  to one of these associates, Johannes Kleiman, and resigned his directorship,
  to avoid allowing the companies to be seized as &ldquo;Jewish-owned.&rdquo; When
  his daughter, Margot, received a summons to appear for transport to a work
  camp, he activated his plan: The family left their home in a disheveled state
  (to suggest a hasty departure); left notes implying an escape to Switzerland
  (where they had family); and even left behind Anne&rsquo;s pet cat, Moortje. They
  wore several layers of clothes (because suitcases would have aroused suspicion),
  and walked in the summer heat (because Jews were forbidden on public transit)
  to Prinsengracht 263. There they stepped through a hole behind a bookcase
  into the 
  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "achterhuis");LangBoxJ("EN", "back house");</script>, and into history.</p>
<p>Because of Otto&rsquo;s position and planning, the <span class="dropnote">achterhuis</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> was
  much more comfortable than most hiding places used by Jews in Amsterdam, so
  much so that he was able to bring in a total of eight people: his family of
  four, the three members of the van Pels family (referred to as the &ldquo;van Daan&rdquo;
  family in the diary), and Fritz Pfeffer (whom Anne detested, naming him &ldquo;Alfred
  <script>LangBoxJ("DE", "Dussel");LangBoxJ("EN", "Nitwit");</script>&rdquo; in the diary). And because of Otto&rsquo;s brilliance, it was ingeniously concealed:
  Prinsengracht 263 had less depth than most houses on its block, but the addition
  of the achterhuis made the rear of the property align with the neighboring
  structures. Thus, the four helpers were able to keep an active factory in operation
  without most people in the 
  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "voorhuis");LangBoxJ("EN", "front house");</script> 
  having any awareness of the additional structure. And even for those workers
  who needed to enter the lower two floors of the achterhuis, there was no connection
  to the area in which the refugees were sequestered. From the back, there was
  nothing to suggest a separation of structures that the authorities might wish
  to investigate. And from the street level it was impossible to see the achterhuis
  at all. </p>

					  used the term
					  &ldquo;Secret Annexe&rdquo; (or its Dutch or German equivalents) in

<p>The house and museum are well laid out for telling the story of Anne and her
  family (as long as you&rsquo;re not in a wheelchair, as is unfortunately the case
  for most historic structures). The visit winds first through the front offices,
  then through the hidden entrance that the family passed through sixty-seven
  years ago &ndash; first to the lower floor of their living quarters, and then
  to the upper. The attic was not accessible, but the stairs were open and a
  mirror had been placed to allow a view of the struggling <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Anne Frank tree");LangBoxJ("NL", "Anne Frankboom");</script>, a horse-chestnut, set behind the house, the sight of which gave Anne much
  pleasure during her confinement. </p>
<p>At one point, Anne wrote in her diary that her fondest wish upon being freed
  from hiding would be to go back to school. Anne never got that wish, as
  she died sick, alone, and far from home at the hands of people who hated and
  brutalized her for nothing more than her genealogy. Perhaps it would bring
  her some comfort to know that, even though she never returned to the classroom,
  she has become required reading for schoolchildren around the globe. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this story hits me so hard. Around six million Jews had their
  lives snuffed out in the Holocaust, and the suffering of each one of them was
  just as much a sacrilege as the intimidation, hunting, torture, and murder
  of Anne Frank and her family. And I&rsquo;ve never even read <i>The Diary of a Young
  Girl</i> (the official English name of her
  memoir). But in researching this section
  I&rsquo;ve easily shed as many tears for Anne as I did for John. The story is utterly
  heartbreaking to me. </p>

<p>I think there are several embers that cause the fire of this story to sear
  at me so unrelentingly: As reflected in her diary, Anne was very much the mix
  of optimism and pragmatism and introspection that I try to balance in my own
  life: She gets angry at people (as I do), and then rebukes herself for her anger
  (as I do), and then tries to see things from a different perspective (as I
  do), and experiences a mixture of success and failure (as I do). And beyond
  all of these issues, she was absolutely full of hope, and I so want to believe
  that an innocent fifteen-year-old girl could be saved from a murderous mob
  by hope &ndash; as would be the case in Hollywood, a place of glamour and hope
  that filled Anne&rsquo;s daydreams.</p>
<p>But most tragic aspect to me is that, at every turn, they <i>almost</i> made it. The timeline is as heartbreaking as the story.</p>

<p>Anne and Margot, of course, never did return.</p>
<p>With nowhere else to go, Otto
  returned to Prinsengracht 263, where he resumed his work with
  earnest determination in a building that must, in many ways, have haunted him.
  The diary was published in 1947, and soon thereafter Otto resigned in deference
  to the publicity needs in sharing with the world his daughter&rsquo;s opus. It may
  be true that Otto and the four helpers survived the war, but in some ways their
  lives were still cut short by the world&rsquo;s need for them to act, not on their
  own, but as a vehicle for telling the story of Anne Frank. It is a testament
  to their integrity, a mitzvah, that they all did so without complaint. </p>
<p>As of this writing, only the secretary, Miep Gies, still remains alive. At
  100 years old, she is reportedly still alert, still follows the news, and still
  spends every August 4 in mourning. </p>

After leaving the Anne Frank House, it was nearing lunchtime, and an opportunity
  to sit and reflect was something we both wanted and needed. We found an adorable
  caf&eacute; with wicker chairs on a bridge over the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Singel");LangBoxJ("EN", "Circle");</script> 
  (Amsterdam&rsquo;s oldest
  canal, which &ndash; by the way &ndash; isn&rsquo;t a circle). On the day we sat there it was windy and a little chilly, and the food was filling
  but not very special; in my memory, as I write this several months later, it
  was perfect. Billy had eggs with ham and cheese over toast (a Dutch specialty
  according to the waiter, although not substantially different from an Egg McMuffin);
  I had mushrooms in cream sauce over bread (which seemed unusual to me, and
  quite tasty, but which according to the waiter was not a Dutch specialty,
  but rather just food). </p>
<p>And after lunch, we backtracked to the 
  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Keizersgracht");LangBoxJ("EN", "Emperor&rsquo;s Canal");</script>
  to see the Homomonument, one of the most unique monuments in the world, both
in form as well as in function &ndash; and, indeed, one that was especially meaningful
to us.</p>
<p>The conception of the Homomonument, commemorating all of those who have been
  persecuted for their homosexuality, came in 1970 when gay activists were arrested
  and denounced for attempting to place a lavender wreath at the 
  <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "National (War) Memorial");LangBoxJ("NL", "Nationaal Monument");</script> 
  at Amsterdam&rsquo;s Dam Square. Construction of the monument advanced fairly quickly,
  and in 1980 a jury selected the design by Karin Daan for the Homomonument.
   The design is a large <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "36 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "118'", false);</script> triangle, with smaller <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "10 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "33'", false);</script> 
   triangles at its points. Each of the points has a time
   period, a height, a direction, and
   (for lack of a better term) a shtick:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The side by the canal represents the present, and dips down
    to nearly the level of the water. It points (perhaps accusingly)
    toward the National Memorial, where the whole thing started, and (perhaps
    for this reason, or perhaps simply because it is the most striking point
    of the monument) it is where wreaths of remembrance are typically placed.</li>
  <li>Moving clockwise, the next point represents the future. It is raised <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "60 cm", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "24&quot;", false);</script> 
  above the ground level, and points in the
  direction of <span class="dropnote">COC&nbsp;Nederland</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. Because it is slightly higher than the plaza level, this point is frequently used as a podium.</li>
<table class="dropnoteframe">

					<td>I know this sounds like a disco, but it&rsquo;s actually the
  oldest continuously operating gay/lesbian organization in the world. Ironically,
  COC&rsquo;s name was originally intended &ndash; apparently in a bygone era when fewer people
  spoke English &ndash; to conceal the organization&rsquo;s focus. It stands for 
  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Cultuur en Ontspanningscentrum");LangBoxJ("EN", "Center for Culture and Leisure");</script>.</td>

  <li>The remaining triangle represents the past and rests at ground level. It points
    in the direction of the Anne Frank House. And it carries a line from a poem
    by the Dutch, gay, Jewish writer, Jacob Israël de Haan: 
    <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;Naar Vriendschap Zulk een Mateloos Verlangen&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Such a Boundless Longing for Friendship&rdquo;");</script>. (And frankly, if I may editorialize, I don&rsquo;t quite get why this particular
    line was considered so evocative and meaningful in this context.) Anyway,
    if you&rsquo;re wondering about the full text, here you go: </li>

<p>And if I may further editorialize, it strikes me that the Dutch are entirely
  too comfortable with the word &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; As you&rsquo;ll remember from my background
  on the Netherlands in yesterday&rsquo;s write-up, the Queen&rsquo;s official titles actually
  carry the word &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; three times at the end. And now this ostensible
  love poem presents us not with love, but instead with &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m
  left with the impression that if one asked directions to Paris, the reply might
  be, &ldquo;Take
  the road toward Utrecht, etc.&rdquo; Or that Dutch recipes trail off with instructions
  like, &ldquo;Separate the yolks from 3 eggs, etc.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Homomonument, by the way, is in the back yard of the 
  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Westerkerk");LangBoxJ("EN", "Western Church");</script>, which is easily, in my mind, the most beautiful church in Amsterdam (especially
  its spire) &ndash; but
  which I found myself unable to photograph because it was so enormously tall
  and because I didn&rsquo;t have the brains to walk across the canal. Still, I did
  snap a shot of the cool Roman numerals on the back side, which are in the older
  style and read, <span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">cI<span style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1em">&#x0254;</span>I<span style="font-size:1.05em; line-height:1em">&#x0254;</span>cxxx</span>.</p>

Rounding out a day of memorials to suffering, I went over to see the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Auschwitz Memorial");LangBoxJ("NL", "Auschwitzmonument");</script> in Wertheimpark, which marks the location of an urn containing the remains of victims of Auschwitz. The
monument consists of an upright glass panel reading, 
  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;Nooit Meer Auschwitz&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Never Again Auschwitz&rdquo;");</script>, and broken mirrors on the ground
to reflect a broken sky. The artist&rsquo;s words are preserved in Dutch and English

Tot barstens toe kan je je hersens afp&#x0133;nigen of er een beeld wil opdoemen dat die schande en dat leed b&#x0133; benadering zou kunnen weergeven.

En in een visioen van rechtvaardigheid zie je de blauwe lucht boven je vol barsten trekken, alsof de verschrikking die daar op aarde onder haar heeft plaatsgehad voorgoed de eeuwigheid geschonden heeft. Zo ben ik op het idee gekomen om gebroken spiegels op dat kleine stukje aarde boven die urn met as neer te leggen.

<p>I had also wanted to visit the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Dutch Resistance Museum");LangBoxJ("NL", "Verzetsmuseum");</script>, but Amsterdam Tourist Info. had never heard of it, even though it was highly

After the memorial, I reconnoitered with Billy for supper. Having discovered the convenience of Amsterdam&rsquo;s public transit infrastructure, we had picked up 48-hour transit passes as soon as yesterday&rsquo;s 24-hour passes expired, to carry us through the end of our stay in Amsterdam. Realizing how dependent we had become on the trams after just one single day in the city, we immediately felt a deeper appreciation for the emphasis given in the Anne Frank House about Jews being barred from the trams and buses.</p>
	<p>Most of our tram trips had been on lines 1, 2, and 5, and had passed through a neighborhood called Leidseplein, which we had remarked might be a nice place to come back to for dinner. So we hopped back on the tram and made our way up there.</p>
	<p>I first had to hunt for money. If I&rsquo;d been listening attentively, I&rsquo;d have realized the ATM I needed was directly across the street. Fortunately,  my listening skills were below par that day, which gave us a chance to explore the neighborhood.</p>
	<p>I was quite amused to find a pissoir on the streets of Amsterdam. These public urinals have been all-but-entirely removed from the streets of Paris, where most Americans became familiar with them. But they remain a fixture of the streets of Amsterdam (at least, according to Wikipedia; this, however, is the only one that I saw). They leave very little to the imagination &ndash; hiding neither the identity of the person inside, nor the activity he is performing; generally, only the span from torso to knees is concealed from public scrutiny. In Islam, nudity occurs between the naval and the knees &#8211; and if the Netherlands weren&rsquo;t so relentlessly Islamophobic, I would wonder wonder at the coincidence.</p>
	<p>Just past the pissoir was a cool sculpture of iguanas, made all the more intriguing by a cat wandering in their midst.</p>
	<p>And finally, we encountered a crowd watching a game of <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "chess");LangBoxJ("NL", "schaken");</script> being played on one of those giant chessboards &ndash; the first time that I&rsquo;ve seen on of those giant boards actually in use.</p>
	<p>And at last I found the ATM and took out some euro, and we found a restaurant. In this case, we wanted to try 
<script>LangBoxJ("NL", "pannenkoeken");LangBoxJ("EN", "Dutch pancakes");</script>, which have a diameter similar to a cr&ecirc;pe, and a thickness between a cr&ecirc;pe and an American pancake. Only Billy followed through on the experiment, though, selecting a ham-and-cheese pannenkoeke. I saw mussels on the menu and remembered something from KLM&rsquo;s in-flight guide to Amsterdam about mussels being a specialty that we should look for. It&rsquo;s hard to say who chose most wisely: The pannenkoeke was both delicious and unusual (he let me taste it), but the mussels were both spectacular and plentiful, coming in a deep pot that I wasn&rsquo;t even sure I could finish off (yet I did). For dessert I had 
<script>LangBoxJ("NL", "poffertjes");LangBoxJ("IPA", "/pɔfərcəs/");</script>, a Dutch treat that is not unlike a beignet (but maybe a bit more buttery). Billy punted and had apple pie.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dutch Islamophobia, our waiter was Muslim. As our visit coincided with Ramadan, I commented on this fact and wished him &#8220;Ramadan Mubarak,&#8221; the standard greeting for the holy month. He was astonished, and enormously pleased, that we had even heard of Ramadan, let alone that we knew the greeting and chose to express it to him. I explained that in America it was fairly commonplace to know the rhythms of other religions, which was a piece of good news that took him completely by surprise. I think we made good ambassadors in this interaction.</p>
	<p>After dinner, we took the tram back to Station Centraal, walked back over to the Vita Nova, and watched movies on Billy&rsquo;s laptop until we were ready to fall asleep.</p>
