<script>WriteH1HeaderJ("What I Left Behind")</script>
	<p>Whenever I come home from a trip, there are several people among my friends with whom I&rsquo;m eager to share the details.  For me, the trip itself is just about one-third of the fun of traveling; the remaining two-thirds are in the excitement of planning, and in the joy of recounting the stories to family and friends.</p>
	<p>But one friend in particular has been a most delightful person with whom to share mutual tales of conquest. Traveling together was out of the question &ndash; his style tended toward investigating the minutiae of museums both famous and obscure, while my style leans more toward <i>The Amazing Race</i> &ndash; but the conversations we shared about the places and the people and the politics were deeply cherished.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, they were also over: On Thursday evening, when I had planned
	  to be packing for the trip, I was instead standing outside of John Speaks&rsquo;s
	  home with various neighbors and friends with whom he had missed appointments
	  in the previous couple of days. When
	  a police officer arrived to supervise our entry into his house (where his
	  car was in the driveway and several lights were on), the front door key
	  was handed to me. (I don&rsquo;t know why I was given this solemn and terrible
	  responsibility, but I&rsquo;m honored that I was.) I opened the door to find
	  John in his foyer where he had apparently died from a heart attack sometime
	  in the previous two days.</p>
	<p>John would not have wanted his death to ruin my trip, and I hope that he somehow is able to know that it didn&rsquo;t. But the things I would have shared with him upon my return resonated all that much more strongly in my mind knowing that he wouldn&rsquo;t be there to hear my stories, and to tell me his own, when I got back to Atlanta in September.</p>
	<p>The presence of John was deeply felt on this trip, so much so that it is essential to the story that I embed it just as emphatically here. To this end, I will be marking issues that I suspect would be meaningful to John with boxes like this: </p>

<p><img src="20090829/AdAAD.jpg" class="PictureFloatLeft" />As one who hungers for new experiences, I was pleased to have a chance to experience one of the new millimeter wave scanners when I passed through airport security. They were not part of the standard protocol (being used, rather, for secondary screening when needed), but when I asked if the booth was one of the new devices, the TSA agent confirmed that it was and invited me to try it if I wanted. Some people are horrified at the idea of a TSA employee at a different location seeing her or his quasi-naked image flash quickly on screen among a series of hundreds or thousands of quasi-naked images. I find those concerns dangerously absurd, and eagerly accepted the invitation. My only disappointment is that the machines take so long: I had to step into the booth and stand with my feet apart and my arms down by my side (but not touching my sides), wait for a scan that took a couple of seconds, shift my orientation in the machine by a quarter turn, keep the same stance except this time raise my arms above my head, wait another couple of seconds for the scan, and then step out and wait about 10 seconds for the sequestered analyst to communicate by phone with the supervising TSA agent. As for results, though, it was good: Obviously, I wasn&rsquo;t carrying anything inappropriate, but he knew that there was a dense item in my front left pocket (my passport) that merited further investigation. If they can get enough of these machines, or can improve the speed issues, I&rsquo;d love to see them replace the ancient metal detectors.</p>
<p>Waiting for the plane was a bit Kafkaesque &ndash; or, at least, the parts of it inside my mind were a bit Kafkaesque. I was still shell-shocked from the sad and gruesome events of the night before. And I was also a bit self-conscious that I was heading to Amsterdam without telling my well-liked former neighbor, Aaron. This was an important point because he had family in Amsterdam and had long encouraged me to see the city, and to make arrangements to stay with his family while there. But our time was so short in Amsterdam that I hadn&rsquo;t pursued this opportunity, a decision that I rationalized because I hadn&rsquo;t seen Aaron very frequently since he had moved away after a divorce, as his schedule for visiting his children across the street from my house didn&rsquo;t overlap very often with the times I was at home. Still, I felt a tinge of guilt that I hadn&rsquo;t tried harder to include Aaron&rsquo;s generous offer in our plans, and hoped that I would be able to dodge mention of it long enough after our return that he wouldn&rsquo;t take offense. I think, in fact, that I was mulling this awkward anxiety at the exact moment I noticed that Aaron&rsquo;s niece was one of our fellow passengers &ndash; which was also the exact moment that she noticed me. She was on her way to Addis Ababa, just transferring in Amsterdam, so with such a long agenda ahead of her, I hope that it won&rsquo;t cross her mind to (accidentally, of course) rat us out. I would hate for Aaron to think that I didn&rsquo;t appreciate his offer enormously, merely because I neglected to act on it. </p>
<p>As for the flight itself, I thought KLM was superb. Except for the seat size,
  coach on KLM was better than Business Class on Delta on our previous trip &ndash; especially
  with regard to the things that matter to me: food and entertainment. Indeed,
  the entertainment options were head and shoulders above what we had in BusinessElite
  in 2007: The seatback console provided games, language lessons, and a multitude
  of movies. I studied a little Dutch, thinking I wouldn&rsquo;t need it. (Boy was
  I mistaken! This was an enormously productive use of my time.) And I watched <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em>.
  I wanted to stay up all night watching movies, as the selection coincided quite
  strongly with my movie-watching agenda &ndash; but my common sense got the
  better of my excitement, so I took a reluctant pass on <em>Frost/Nixon</em>, <em>Man
  on Wire</em>, <em>Star Trek XI</em>, <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>,
  and <em>The Watchmen</em>.</p>
<p>Also, I considered it auspicious that the plane was named after an important site at the central destination of this trip: We flew to Amsterdam on the <i>Place de la Concorde - Paris</i>. </p>

	<p>One could go mad trying to look for a moral lesson in the history of the Netherlands; there is simply too much conflicting data. The best observation I can give you is that the Netherlands offers something for everyone, and has listed to the extremes from its distant past to the present day. Now the Netherlands is viewed as a tight-knit society intent on improving its quality of life while serving as an example for the world; in the not-so-distant past, it was simply a tight-knit society intent on improving its quality of life.</p>
	<p>Now known as exhibiting extraordinary open-mindedness, the original exposure of the Dutch to other cultures came in the context of their nation&rsquo;s expansion as a colonial power. And with this expansion came the usual set of moral compromises:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><img src="20090829/Zwarte_Piet.gif" class="PictureFloatRight" />The Dutch may have developed a near-utopia back home, but they sowed the foundation for Apartheid with the engagement of the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Dutch East India Company");LangBoxJ("NL", "Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie")</script> in <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Cape Town");LangBoxJ("NL", "Kaapstad");</script>.</li>
		<li>Many persons of African descent in the U.S. and the Caribbean have ancestors who came to the New World in the cargo holds of Dutch slave ships.</li>
		<li>In the weeks before Christmas, the Dutch roll out not only the cross-cultural seasonal icon, <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Sinterklaas");LangBoxJ("EN", "Saint Nicholas");</script> (their version, BTW, spends the off-season in Spain rather than the North Pole), but also their own specific overlay to the holiday pantheon in the form of Sinterklaas&rsquo;s lackey, <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Zwarte Piet");LangBoxJ("EN", "Black Pete");</script>, whom Dutch teenagers emulate by costuming themselves in blackface, afro wigs, and garish red lipstick. You can see an example of Zwarte Piet in the image to the right.</li>
		<li>Only 1% of English words are of Dutch origin, but the worst racial epithet of our language is among them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Netherlands is highly respected by politicians on the left as an example of what can be achieved by socialist ideals, and as an emblem of the most positive, most nurturing connotations of the term &ldquo;welfare state.&rdquo; Yet, in reality, the Netherlands ranks #13 (77%) on the so-called &ldquo;Index of Economic Freedom&rdquo; (in which the most capitalist economies are at the top), just 3.7 percentage points behind the U.S. (#6 at 80.7%), and well above reputedly ultra-capitalist Japan (#19 at 72.8%). And let us not forget that Holland was the site of <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Tulip mania");LangBoxJ("NL", "Tulpenmanie");</script>, in which the Dutch became so consumed by greed, speculation, and the &ldquo;greater fool&rdquo; theory that a single tulip bulb sold in 1636 for <span class="dropnote">2,500ƒ</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.</p>
<table class="dropnoteframe">

					<th>➴</th>
					<td>This might prompt two questions: (1) What(&rsquo;s) the &ldquo;f&rdquo;? and (2) What&rsquo;s that worth?<br>
			<br>
			The first question is easy. &ldquo;ƒ&rdquo; is the symbol for the Dutch guilder. In case the connection isn&rsquo;t obvious, a 1-guilder coin was called a florin (named for a much older currency unit of the Netherlands), and the initial of the word &ldquo;florin&rdquo; came to be the currency symbol for the guilder.<br>
			<br>
			Comparisons of value are difficult, but Wikipedia offers that one
			guilder at that time would equate to about <script>MeasurementBoxJ("EUR", "&euro;&nbsp;10.28", true);MeasurementBoxJ("USD", "$15.17", false);</script> in today&rsquo;s money,
			so the <b>2,500ƒ</b> sum
			in modern times would approximate 
			<script>MeasurementBoxJ("EUR", "&euro;&nbsp;25,700", true);MeasurementBoxJ("USD", "$37,924", false);</script>.  Just to throw in some much-needed perspective, though: This extraordinary price for a single tulip bulb was roughly forty times the amount (<b>60ƒ</b> worth of goods) that the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Dutch West India Company");LangBoxJ("NL", "Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie");</script> paid for Manhattan ten years previous.</td>

<p>And though it is indisputably true that the Netherlands is an exemplar of
  democratic opportunity, it is also a hereditary monarchy. So while every Dutch
  schoolchild may grow up believing that she or he could someday hold Prime Minister
  Jan Peter Balkenende&rsquo;s job (although so far only little Dutch school<i>boys</i> have
  actually managed to pull it off), only one of them is encouraged in the belief that
  he could someday hold Queen Beatrix&rsquo;s. On a more frivolous note regarding
  the Dutch monarchy, the queen&rsquo;s title illuminates a wonderful
  cut-to-the-chase mentality that I have come to associate with the Dutch: 
  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;Beatrix, Majesteit en by die genade van God, koningin van die Nederlande, prinses van Oranje-Nassau, <b>enz. enz. enz.</b>&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Beatrix, by the Grace of God, Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, <b>etc. etc. etc.</b>&rdquo;");</script>. That triple <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "enz.");LangBoxJ("EN", "etc.");</script> 
  is official: It always appears, and it always appears <i>thrice</i>.
  It elides the following titles (the dormant ones of which are kept in the masculine
  form by protocol):</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll concede that much of my criticism of the Netherlands is nitpicking, being
  either ancient history, or not that important. But one legitimate gripe about
  the country is in its environmental commitment: The Netherlands was an early
  signatory of the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions, yet environmental
  consequence at (and below) sea level hasn&rsquo;t been treated with the same priority for this, the lowest
  of the Low Countries: Indeed, while we in Georgia (hardly a bulwark of environmental
  responsibility) agonize over whether water releases from Lake Lanier are adequate
  to preserve the mussel populations in the Apalachicola, the Netherlands has
  been terraforming its north for so long that a specific geographic coordinate
  cannot be described as land, lake, or sea without bringing in the variable
  of time: What was known as 
  <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Lacus Flevo");LangBoxJ("EN", "Flevo Lake");</script> 
	  in Roman times later became the much larger, salt-water 
	  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Zuiderzee");LangBoxJ("EN", "Southern Sea");</script>, and then, through a massive series of dams, was turned into the fresh-water 
	  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&#x0132;sselmeer");LangBoxJ("EN", "Lake &#x0132;ssel");</script>. Amsterdam is a major center for oceangoing ships, yet its port is fresh
	  water and unaffected by tides. The &#x0132;, Amsterdam&rsquo;s waterfront, is described
	  in Wikipedia as &ldquo;a river, formerly a bay.&rdquo; And the vast majority
	  of Dutch windmills are not for electric power generation, but simply for moving
the water back up the hill to the sea.</p>
<p>There is a story of uncertain veracity about <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Cnut the Great");LangBoxJ("NON", "Knūtr inn rīki");</script>: that he had his throne set on a beach, and sitting there he commanded the
	  tides to halt. When the waters impassively rose up to cover his feet and wet
	  his robes, he spoke with a rehearsed humility to his subjects: &ldquo;Let all
	  men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none
	  worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.&rdquo; Yet
	  an entirely different scene has played out in Holland: The people who couldn&rsquo;t
	  hold back the Nazis for more than five days have been holding back the ocean
	  for nearly a millennium. The English long ago made an observation that has
	  stuck through the ages: God made the world, but the Dutch made Holland.</p>
<p>Yet the Dutch are nothing if not self-aware about their physical circumstances. One of the best quotes from a regent who was a font of wonderful quotes, came when Queen Wilhelmina visited Germany&rsquo;s Kaiser Wilhelm II prior to the hostilities of the <span class="dropnote">First World War</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. Kaiser Wilhelm tried to intimidate the queen, saying &ldquo;My guards are seven feet tall and yours are only shoulder-high to them.&rdquo; Queen Wilhelmina replied, &ldquo;Quite true, Your Majesty, your guards are seven feet tall. But when we open our dikes, the water is ten feet deep!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>So please understand that it is not my intention to disparage the Dutch, but rather simply to offer
	  a &ldquo;reality check&rdquo; on our external perceptions of this country. I could
	  never begin to dispute the underlying assumption: By and large, the Dutch
	  people, and their governmental policies, are of a stock that the rest of
	  the world would do well to emulate. Indeed, I think the Dutch might collectively
	  set an example for the United States as to how a nation that functions
	  as a colonialist superpower, and serves its own aggrandizement, can later
	  learn from its mistakes, restrain its reach, tighten its focus, and come
	  to serve the world as an example of peace rather than as an instrument
	  of war. But let us, and them, never forget how much blood, and how many
	  tears, they went through to get where they are. </p>

We were already a bit uncertain what to do with ourselves showing up in Amsterdam at the crack of dawn (several hours before check-in opened at our hotel). An extra hour meant we had more time to wander the streets like zombies, and less to nap on the plane.</p>

	<p>Schiphol is supposed to be one of the finest airports in the world. I was excited to see what that was like after spending the last vacation at the other end of the bell curve in Larnaca, Amman, Cairo, and Luxor. Schiphol was nice (much nicer than those four, certainly) &ndash; but I&rsquo;ve still never seen an airport that caused me to think, &ldquo;I want to make a special effort to come/transit/avoid here just because of this facility.&rdquo; One of the things that&rsquo;s supposed to put Schiphol above its peers is that it has shower facilities available for travelers, but we put a lot of effort into into finding them and came up empty. The people at tourist information told us they had never heard of the showers and had never received that question before (and regarded us with such a mixture of amusement and skepticism that the honesty of their response was not in doubt).</p>
<p>
<script>WriteNetherlandsSign("Car", "Amsterdam", 17);</script>
Finally, we gave up and decided to go into town, which gave us more opportunity (indeed, more opportunity than we wanted) to explore the offerings of the airport: First the ING ATMs wouldn&rsquo;t accept my card (who knows why? I worried that it was the beginning of a long string of money woes, but it wasn&rsquo;t). Then the ticket machines for the train to 
	  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Station Amsterdam Centraal");LangBoxJ("EN", "Amsterdam Central Station");</script> 
  insisted on my entering my credit card PIN. I had actually documented my PIN, but saved it in a protected Access database, which required finding a place to look up the file on Billy&rsquo;s laptop, which required finding a power outlet after his use of the machine on the long flight, which proved difficult (we had the European plugs, but found ourselves wanting for a socket). Finally, I remembered a second password file in my PDA, found the PIN, got the tickets, and got us on the train. Maybe it&rsquo;s just &rsquo;cause we were so groggy, but it all seemed more difficult than it should have been.</p>
	<p>The name of the airport, by the way, means &ldquo;Ship Hole&rdquo; in English, which sounds inauspicious, but is actually rooted in history: Like much of the Netherlands, the point where Schiphol sits used to be open water until it was drained in 1852 to form the Haarlemmermeer polder. The lake at that site was prone to violent weather that made it perilous for ships, giving it a name that has survived over the decades from sea to land to air. The airport is entirely below sea level, with some of the runways being as much as <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "3 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "9.8'", false);</script> below the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Normaal Amsterdams Peil");LangBoxJ("EN", "Amsterdam Ordnance Datum");</script>, which is the slightly fuzzy approximation of sea level used in official documentation for the Netherlands.</p>
	<p>	  We made  our way into town by train, helped by a hip American ex-pat who didn&rsquo;t pay the fare (because &ldquo;they never check on this line&rdquo;) and who told us  that Amsterdam was more conservative than people think (and getting  even more so), that the pot is better in California, and that it wasn&rsquo;t really a party town because the bars and transit close early. She also confirmed what we had heard elsewhere: Despite a &ldquo;touristy&rdquo; reputation, the canal  cruises are pretty interesting.</p>
	<p>	  Hotel check-in didn&rsquo;t open until 11:00 AM, so we tried to waste time walking around  Amsterdam, and found ourselves instantly, by chance, in the Red Light District. I&rsquo;ve got a section on it below from my return after nightfall, but suffice it to say now that sunlight did the place no favors: If you don&rsquo;t find a prostitute enticing at dusk on a crowded street that smells like beer, you won&rsquo;t find her enticing in the glare of the morning on an empty street that smells like vomit. </p>
	<p>	  Billy  and I just walked around Amsterdam getting our bearings. First we discovered a nice Jewish memorial along the Amstel River. Then, to avoid a rain shower, we ducked under the 
	  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Munttoren");LangBoxJ("EN", "Mint Tower");</script>, a beautiful tower with a weird history of possibly-unnecessary rebuilding: The original was built around 1487 and survived a fire in 1618 without major damage. Still, it was renovated in 1620, and then torn down in 1885 to make way for the current version. An underpass was added in 1939, and it was there that we hid from the rain. The tower&rsquo;s name comes from the fact that it was used to mint coins during the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Rampjaar");LangBoxJ("EN", "Disastrous Year");</script>, in which both France and England declared war on the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ");LangBoxJ("NL", "Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden");</script>. It rises above the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Muntplein");LangBoxJ("EN", "Mint Square");</script>, <span class="dropnote">where the Amstel River ends</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.</p>

					<td>What, you&rsquo;ve never heard of a river just &ldquo;ending,&rdquo; in a crowded (non-aqueous) public square? This is not even the most cunning of the tricks the Dutch have played on their watery environs. The Amstel used to flow through town, past the dam at <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Dam Square");LangBoxJ("NL", "de Dam");</script>, from which Amsterdam (formerly &ldquo;Amste<u>l</u>dam,&rdquo; and before that &ldquo;Amste<u>lre</u>dam&rdquo;) took its name.<br>
<br>
Now, however, the last leg of the Amstel has been filled in and is a major street known as the Rokin, taken from the Dutch word, <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;rak&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;straight body of water&rdquo;");</script>. The water doesn&rsquo;t stop, of course, just because the river does; it gets past downtown via the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Grachtengordel");LangBoxJ("EN", "Canal Belt");</script> and through a set of pipes under the Rokin.<br>
<br>
The Amstel, by the way, is only <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "31 km", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "19 miles", false);</script> long, which may partially account for another quirk of its geography: Even in such a waterlogged environment, the Amstel has only one island, tiny <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "5-ha", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "12.4-acre", false);</script> <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Amsteleiland");LangBoxJ("EN", "Amstel Island");</script> in the town of Amstelveen.</td>

	<p>One of the most interesting sites that Billy and I passed was the Bloemenmarkt, a floating flower market along the Singel, Amsterdam&rsquo;s oldest canal. I really wish I&rsquo;d spend more time in the Bloemenmarkt when I was there, but I was exhausted from the flight, didn&rsquo;t realize it floated, didn&rsquo;t recognize it as one of the few places that might have sold wooden shoes, and wasn&rsquo;t aware of how unique it was in the street life of the city. I&rsquo;m lucky that I saw it at all, but disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t see it better.</p>
	<p>And one joy of Amsterdam was simply the architecture. It&rsquo;s not the brutish
	  look of the British Isles, which can leave one with the impression that
	  they threw up their buildings with leftover road- and rail-building supplies.
	  And it&rsquo;s not the garish rococo of France, which often looks like angels
	  barfed on the side of the building. Instead, it&rsquo;s just <i>perfect</i>: Every
	  building is ornamented in <i>exactly</i> the right proportion. Large undecorated
	  walls serve as a counterpoint to detailed crenellations at their peaks.
	  The mandatory pulley rings that jut from every attic (as required by law)
	  give Amsterdam an iconic and unique sense of place. The distances between
	  the canals and the canal houses is a celebration of both form and function.
	  Windows have such an ideal relationship to the size of the building that
	  one&rsquo;s heart is immediately filled with hope. And, indeed, hope is called
	  for, as Amsterdam gives the appearance of being in the beginning stages
	  of a domino-like collapse, with houses leaning, often at precipitous angles,
	  into their neighbors. </p>
	<p>	  Filled with such hope, we considered McDonalds for lunch; Billy and
	  I had great experiences with McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants in Italy and Switzerland,
	  where they have unique architecture and unusual additions to the menu. Indeed,
	  while it wasn&rsquo;t fine food by any stretch of the imagination, McDonald&rsquo;s in
	  Italy was one of the few opportunities to eat something that Italians enjoyed,
	  and that was completely and absolutely unavailable in the U.S. But efforts
	  to duplicate this discovery in other areas have been unsuccessful to say the
	  least: McDonald&rsquo;s in Mexico, France, and Greece were the same lard-and-salt
	  factories that we knew from home. And this McDonald&rsquo;s appeared to trend toward
	  the Mexico/France/Greece model. Also, the service was &ndash; to
	  be generous &ndash; unexceptional.
	  So we left and ducked into a sandwich shop where we had rosti (toasted
	  sandwiches).</p>
	<p>And speaking of Amsterdam, here&rsquo;s a way to start arguments if you&rsquo;re of that particular bent: Find a group people with a middling understanding of European geography, and ask them whether Amsterdam is the Dutch capital. The situation is so murky that Wikipedia actually carries an article titled &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_the_Netherlands" target="_blank">Capital of the Netherlands</a>&rdquo; to thoroughly flesh out the subject. The answer to the question is that Amsterdam <i>is</i> the capital of the Netherlands, based on a single reference in the constitution that the monarch should be coronated (but not live) in 
	  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;de hoofdstad Amsterdam&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;the capital city of Amsteram&rdquo;");</script>. But since 1588, the country&rsquo;s seat of government has been in <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Den Haag");LangBoxJ("EN", "The Hague");</script>, with the Dutch parliament, judicial system, royal offices, and all foreign embassies being located there.</p>
	<p>While Amsterdam&rsquo;s role as capital of the Netherlands is confusing, it&rsquo;s role as capital of the 
	  <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Province of North Holland");LangBoxJ("NL", "Provincie Noord-Holland");</script> is beyond dispute: It <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>. That honor goes to Haarlem, just up the road.</p>
	<p>And here&rsquo;s another tidbit about Amsterdam, to balance the snarking I did in the previous section. The city&rsquo;s motto is <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Valiant, Steadfast, Compassionate&rdquo;");</script>. Americans reading this (and that&rsquo;s pretty much all of you) will initially take this as bullshit civic boosterism, but that&rsquo;s not how it goes down in the Netherlands. The motto was bestowed on the city by Queen Wilhelmina in 1947 to acknowledge the actions of the citizens of Amsterdam during World War II, and especially a single event that overwhelmed her with emotion when she learned of it during her self-imposed exile in London: In February 1941, the citizens of Amsterdam went on strike to protest Nazi persecution of the Jews &ndash; the first time that a gentile population rose up against the anti-Semitism of the Third Reich.</p>

	<p>One amazing aspect of Amsterdam is the bicycles, the sheer quantity of which is amazing (reputedly almost one per citizen). But as someone who uses a bicycle as his primary mode of transportation in a much less bike-friendly city, I&rsquo;ve got to say that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it as the Dutch do:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Most significantly, their bikes are behemoths &ndash; old, heavy, one-speed clunkers with handlebars that come up nearly to shoulder height and seem designed to train the rider in good posture as a side benefit to the commute. They&rsquo;re such tanks that people struggle to pedal them up even the small inclines flanking the numerous canal bridges. Also, they&rsquo;re almost universally in poor maintenance, with half-flat (or completely flat) tires that make the cobblestones of the commute all that much more unbearable. And strikingly for a culture that is generally so sensible, no one wears a helmet. </li>
      <li>Theft is widespread, affecting about one of every eight bikes each
        year. It&rsquo;s facilitated by a lack of serial numbers on the bikes and a
        bureaucratic system of bike repatriation that requires the victim to
        get to a rural depository (not on public transit), describe the bike
        (which is probably pretty easy as 95% of them look about the same), and
        then search for the individual bike in a yard of tens of thousands of
        recovered bicycles.</li>
      <li>There&rsquo;s no place to park. Even with a multi-story parking deck for bicycles just outside the main train station, and bicycle parking barges scattered around the city, most every railing throughout Amsterdam to which a bike could be chained has, indeed, a bike chained to it. It is not uncommon to see bikes dangling over the canals by their security chains, having been heaved over the railing by someone who needed the space.</li>
      <li>Most visitors to Amsterdam comment that &ldquo;every street has a bike lane.&rdquo; It does give that appearance, but the truth of the matter is that a lot of streets <i>don&rsquo;t</i> have a bike lane, and that bikes are not allowed on streets (except very small streets) that lack a bike lane. Even where the lanes exist, they run a circuitous path around the canals, crossing streets at odd angles and merging into pedestrian zones. And the shared environment has its challenges: In theory, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians have their separate spaces and crossing signals. In practice, scooters are consigned to bicycle lanes (and forbidden, like bikes, from the main roadways), so there is a constant speed differential to navigate in the bike environment.  The pedestrian areas are often so narrow that pedestrians are forced into the bike lanes.  And crossing major intersections can be time-consuming as every mode of transportation is separately given its turn.  In some ways it works undeniably, though:  Amsterdam takes it as a point of pride that more people die through murder than through traffic fatalities (26 as compared to 18 in 2007).      </li>
      <li>Unlike most transit systems in the U.S., they have not implemented a strategy for allowing bikes on buses and trams. </li>
</ul>
	<p>If I lived in Amsterdam, I would do things completely differently: I would
	  get a folding bike so I could take it on buses and trams and so I could
	  avoid parking and theft problems by taking it inside buildings. I would
	  have a bike with multiple gears and a broad gear ratio so I could
	  approximate the speed of the scooters and get over the bridges easily.
	  I would keep the tires inflated (as I do at home). I would <i>always, always,
	  always</i> wear a helmet (as I do at home).</p>
	<p>And if I had the power to affect public policy in Amsterdam, I would start from scratch: I&rsquo;d keep the bike lanes, but <span class="dropnote">require bikes to merge into traffic lanes for left turns</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> (which would speed up the intersections, a benefit to traffic and to pedestrians). I would invest in a program like Vélib&rsquo; in Paris, where people can establish memberships in the program, rent bikes when they need them, return them to any location, and be assured of an available bike and an available spot to drop it off. I would start getting rid of the clunker bikes by establishing a disincentive to owning one through parking restrictions and by letting anyone who turned one in have a free membership for five years in the shared bike program. I&rsquo;d put bike racks on the buses and trams. And I&rsquo;d pass a helmet law.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;ve used this line before and I&rsquo;ll almost certainly need to use it again:
	  Traveling teaches you that everything everyone says is wrong. Our first hour
	  in Amsterdam brought us face-to-face with two challenges to our assumptions.</p>
	<p>First, I had heard friends wax on and on about the drainage in Amsterdam.
	  The promise &ndash; described in the telling as literal, not figurative &ndash; was
	  that the Dutch were such masters of drainage that every square centimeter
	  of Amsterdam was inclined just perfectly to channel the rainwater through
	  rivulets between the cobblestones, and back into the canals, such that standing
	  puddles were unheard of. Now I&rsquo;m not going to say that the Dutch don&rsquo;t have
	  a way with water management, but this seemed from the start to be too good
	  to be true. And it was. We arrived after a shower and let me tell you: puddles
	  abounded. </p>
	<p>But the second false promise was even more of a challenge. I had been assured that <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;Spreekt u Engels?&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Do you speak English?&rdquo;");</script> 
	was a phrase I didn&rsquo;t even need to know &ndash; that the Dutch (all of whom,
	like the children of Lake Wobegon, are above average) spoke English fluently
	and unfailingly, and might even take offense if questioned on this point. One
	website cautioned that the Netherlands is the only place in the world where
	it might be considered rude to ask, &ldquo;Do you speak English?,&rdquo; as this
	could imply that their education was lacking. It&rsquo;s complete BS: A lot of people
	speak English there, especially in the tourist trade &ndash; but a lot of them
	don&rsquo;t. And it seems to catch them off-guard if you just walk up and start speaking
	English. </p>
	<p>I will concede that more people spoke English in Amsterdam than in any other non-English-speaking place I&rsquo;ve ever visited. But I did find it striking that very little was <i>written</i> in English. Our train tickets to Paris were indecipherable to us, being entirely in Dutch; restaurant menus were often only in Dutch; public announcements might be bilingual, but written warnings were often just in Dutch; even the emergency diagram at our hotel was exclusively in Dutch. I really am not one of those people who expect to be catered to in English. Heck, I&rsquo;m conversational in six languages. But it seems to me that if you&rsquo;re a tiny country with a boutique language, which attracts a lot of tourists, and in which a lot of people <i>already</i> speak English, you might want to make it easy on everybody and put some of that English in writing.</p>
	<p>One interesting thing about Dutch, though, is the letter <i>&#x0132;</i>. It&rsquo;s sometimes
	  converted to a <i>Y</i>, but generally is left as a letter that resembles
	  a concatenation of the ninth and tenth letters of the English alphabet. Because
	  it is one letter, the capital form is <i>&#x0132;</i>, not <i>Ij</i>, as in several
	  of the land and sea features of North Holland: the &#x0132;, &#x0132;muiden, &#x0132;burg, the
	  &#x0132;meer, and the &#x0132;sselmeer. If you look at the pictures to the right, you&rsquo;ll
	  see an interesting presentation of the digraph in the word 
    <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "l&#x0133;nbus");LangBoxJ("EN", "bus");</script> 
    as it&rsquo;s painted on the street surface. (And because I anticipated the, well, pedantry of some among my friends, who would be quick to say that this picture is two words written from bottom to top (i.e., &ldquo;BUS L&#x0132;N&rdquo;) &ndash; as would, I acknowledge, be the case if the lane marking appeared in America &ndash; I have prepared the second picture, showing that &ldquo;l&#x0133;nbus&rdquo; is, in fact, correct.) And since I&rsquo;m a stickler for details, you&rsquo;ll notice that the letter is indeed one letter where it is used in this report: You can&rsquo;t, for example, select just the <i>J</i> in &#x0132;burg. Indeed, here&rsquo;s what a couple of those words look like in a fixed-width font:</p>

	<p>Another interesting thing about Dutch is the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "tussenvoegsel");</script> (plural is <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "tussenvoegsels");</script>&nbsp;); this is the connecting word (or group of words) that comes at the front end of some Dutch surnames.

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t catch them all, though &#8211; just the traditional Dutch tussenvoegsels. The Dutch treat any prepositional prefix in any language as a tussenvoegsel (though I&rsquo;m certain they get sloppy with increasing distance from Western Europe). In fact, it&rsquo;s quite likely that they would consider the &#8220;De&#8221; in my name to be a tussenvoegsel, and alphabetize me under <i>R</i>.</p>
	<p>But while we&rsquo;re on the subject of Dutch surnames, it bears mention that they only have surnames at all because Napoleon forced them adopt this French custom in 1811, and they weren&rsquo;t overly fond of the idea. Convinced that the imposition wouldn&rsquo;t last, many of them thumbed their noses at the system by choosing words that must seem vexatious to their descendents, examples among them being

If you know me, you also know that the unusual is more of a draw to me (far more of a draw) than the luxurious. This is how Billy and I have ended up at some pretty interesting hotels:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A haunted castle in Inverness, Scotland; </li>
      <li>Cliffside rooms in Sorrento, Italy; </li>
      <li>A mountaintop observatory in Gornergrat, Switzerland; </li>
      <li>Hanging beds in Puerto Morelos, Mexico; </li>
      <li>A treehouse in San Ignacio, Belize;</li>
      <li>A cave in Santorini, Greece;</li>
      <li>A Bedouin village in Petra, Jordan;</li>
      <li>A desert camp in Wadi Rum, Jordan.</li>
</ul>
	<p>Today continued that tradition, as we checked in to stay at the Vita Nova, a houseboat hotel floating in the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Oosterdok");LangBoxJ("EN", "East Docks");</script>, one of the components of Amsterdam&rsquo;s complicated waterfront. We had speculated that the treehouse might approximate the solution to a puzzle regarding the smallest amount of space that might still contain two beds and a door that opened inward. The Vita Nova reminded us that we had not considered bunk beds as we contemplated the solution to that puzzle.</p>
	<p>Three nights was actually a bit too long for my taste, but I&rsquo;m really glad
	  to have had the experience for at least one night. And that first night
	  was especially spectacular, with a violent storm rolling over Amsterdam
	  as we were going to sleep, continuing for hours afterward, giving us the
	  sounds of sloshing water, driving rain, and deafening thunderclaps. I love
	  that kind of thing (I also love turbulence in airplanes), so it was a nice
    night for me. </p>
	<p>The Vita Nova comprises three levels: The <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "upper deck");LangBoxJ("NL", "bovendeks");</script> is a little-used communal space and observation deck. The <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "middle deck");LangBoxJ("NL", "middendeks");</script> has the entrance, a few rooms, the office, and the dining area.  The <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "lower deck");LangBoxJ("NL", "benedendeks");</script> 
	was the location for the motor (unused during our stay) and most of the rooms
	  (including ours).</p>
	<p>The two communal WCs at the Vita Nova were a bit odd: One had to step through
	  a portal into the shower, and then walk through the shower to the toilet.
	  The shower could be separated from the toilet by a curtain, but use of
	  the curtain seemed superfluous (and uncommon) as the entire room drained
	  to the shower basin anyway. There was no sink in the room, as sinks were
	  available in the sleeping quarters. </p>

Well rested from a nap in the Vita Nova, Billy and I picked up 24-hour transit
	  passes and headed up to the Hobbemastraat station for a dinner reservation at Sama Sepo, an Indonesian
	  restaurant famous as one of the best places in town for 
	  <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "r&#x0133;sttafel");LangBoxJ("EN", "rice table");</script>.
	  R&#x0133;staffel is a type of meal ubiquitous at Indonesian restaurants in the
	  Netherlands &ndash; yet the tradition is Dutch,  not Indonesian (although
	  it has since caught on in Indonesia). It is, in fact, an embellishment
	  on the colonial past of the Netherlands (which held Indonesia as a territory
	  until World War II): Rather than serving individual dishes, as is the traditional
	  structure of Indonesian cuisine, a restaurant serving a r&#x0133;staffel will
	  lay out a huge variety of flavors in a Sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord
	  style, allowing one to pick and choose, and mix and match, among the divers
	  spices and presentations native to Indonesia.</p>
	<p>According to Sama Sepo&rsquo;s website, we sampled the following
	  dishes (in addition to two kinds of rice and several varieties of bread): </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Nasi</li>
      <li> Sajor</li>
      <li> Babi Ketjap</li>
      <li> Daging Madura</li>
      <li> Ajam</li>
      <li> Sateh</li>
      <li> Krupuk</li>
      <li> S.G. Sajoran</li>
      <li> S.G. Tahu</li>
      <li> S.G. Kering</li>
      <li> Gado Gado</li>
      <li> Serundeng</li>
      <li> Pisang Goreng</li>
      <li> Rudjak Manis</li>
      <li> Atjar</li>
      <li> Sambal</li>
      <li> Katjang</li>
</ul>
	<p>The names are as meaningless to me as they probably are to you. But I can
	  tell you this: Everything was delicious and plentiful. In truth, I think
	  the list above is abbreviated; there was <i>a
	    lot</i> of
	  food on that table, and it was an effort to be certain that we had at least sampled
	    one of everything.<br>

While waiting for the tram to go back to the hotel, I noticed that we were

	  with us.</p>

After sunset, Billy wanted to rest, but I was interested in seeing the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Red Light District");LangBoxJ("NL", "De Wallen");</script> in a more traditional way (that is, replacing the sunlight
    with people).</p>
	<p>Even though I want to think of myself
	  as the kind of sex-affirming, progressive individual that Amsterdam
	  attracts &ndash; and totally putting aside the fact that all the hookers were
	  women, and that&rsquo;s just not the aisle I shop on &ndash; I&rsquo;ve
	  got to say that I didn&rsquo;t care for the Red Light District. I really don&rsquo;t
	  like any kind of hard sell, no matter if it&rsquo;s cable television or Scientology
	  or prostitution, so having the women behind windows, leering out at me,
	  tapping on their glass for attention, left me cold. And worse, in my opinion,
	  was the architectural injustice: As I noted above, Amsterdam is a spectacular
	  city architecturally, but the red lights and huge glass doors are a completely
	  incongruous juxtaposition with the stately buildings in which they&rsquo;re set
	  &ndash; the same type of glass
	  patio doors that you might find leading from a &rsquo;60s ranch house to its
	  back deck.
	  It&rsquo;s like walking around a giant Renaissance Habitrail, in which all the
	  hamsters want you to fuck them. </p>
	<p>Finally, seeing it in place gave me a sense of the &ldquo;skankiness&rdquo; of
	  the transaction: I had imagined the windowfronts as sales and negotiation
	  zones, with private apartments upstairs where the deed would be done &ndash; but
	  these street level rooms are the entire place of business: Behind each
	  of the windows is a curtain (red, usually), a bed, and a sink. They are
	  utilized in more-or-less that sequence, and then the patron is sent back
	  to the streets of Amsterdam, definitely poorer, and possibly satisfied
	  &ndash; the entire discourse having taken place behind a big glass door that doesn&rsquo;t
	  block much of the sound of the street; that might easily be bumped by the
	  endless multitudes of drunken, stumbling frat boys (or their European equivalents);
	  and that affords no privacy from the throngs of tourists as they watch
	  the customer enter and leave. Also, a strangely overlooked point in the
	  marketing plan is that the red lights illuminate one&rsquo;s teeth in such a
	  grotesque manner that the prostitutes try not to smile.</p>
	<p>I know you will want to know about prices, so I did a little research (<i>not</i> empirically,
	  mind you, but online). Apparently the women pay 
	  <script>MeasurementBoxJ("EUR", "&euro;&nbsp;150.00", true);MeasurementBoxJ("USD", "$222.69", false);</script> 
	  to rent a windowfront for an eight-hour shift, and the market-driven price
	  for a fifteen-minute (or so) no-frills tumble is 
	  <script>MeasurementBoxJ("EUR", "&euro;&nbsp;50.00", true);MeasurementBoxJ("USD", "$74.23", false);</script>.
	  So unless the guy asks for something special, they don&rsquo;t make a
	  profit until the fourth paying customer. 
      Now, &ldquo;something special&rdquo; is in the eye of the beholder: Most people reading
      the phrase probably assume that we&rsquo;re skirting issues such as B&amp;D, S&amp;M, or things with
      more complicated euphemistic initials. But in Amsterdam a surcharge might
      come into play even for requests as basic as seeing the woman nude or receiving
      (or even giving) a massage. From what I&rsquo;ve read, the sessions can be extended
      as long as the guy wants/needs/can&nbsp;afford, but you&rsquo;re unlikely to get a
      discount on the second fifteen minutes. </p>
	<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I went, and if I were in Amsterdam with someone who hadn&rsquo;t
	  seen it, I would eagerly take her or him to tour the district. (And if
	  it was a straight guy, I might even encourage him to do a little of the
	  research that I was unwilling to consider.) But at the end of the day (or,
	  in this case, the night), I&rsquo;m not troubled by the fact that Amsterdam&rsquo;s
	  city leaders are trying to rein in the free-wheeling environment of the
	  Red Light District. No one (yet) seems to be advocating an abolition to
	  legal public prostitution, but about a third of the windowfronts have been
	  taken over by the city, most of them simply closed, but many of them converted
	  to the display of art or fashion.</p>
	<p>But I can&rsquo;t leave the Red Light District without a brief discussion of its
	  location, surrounding the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Oude Kerk");LangBoxJ("EN", "Old Church");</script>. This is a venerable building with a complicated history. Alone among Amsterdam&rsquo;s
	  buildings, it rests unchanged since Rembrandt walked the streets of this
	  city. Having been constructed as a Roman Catholic parish in 1306, it came
	  under the control of Calvinists after the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Alteratie");</script> 
	  in 1578, a bloodless coup in which Roman Catholics were removed from a position
	  of absolute control, to one of a minority voice, in Amsterdam&rsquo;s city government.
	  Despite the acrimonious history, though, the Oude Kerk serves as a staging
	  point for the Roman Catholic <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Stille Omgang");LangBoxJ("EN", "Silent Procession");</script>, which commemorates the 1345 &ldquo;Miracle of the Host,&rdquo; sometimes known, especially in Dutch, as the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Miracle of Amsterdam&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;Mirakel van Amsterdam&rdquo;");</script>. According to the legend, a dying man was given last rites and communion, but vomited it up immediately. In accordance with protocol, the Host was put in a fire &ndash; but it remained intact, and the attendants found that one could retrieve it from the fire in one piece without it being burned. The Vatican certified this miracle and a commemorative chapel was built, the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Heilige Stede");LangBoxJ("EN", "Holy Site");</script>. But in 1908, presumably after centuries of festering acrimony, the chapel
	  was stripped of its materials (to prevent their further use in Catholic
	  worship) and demolished, and the ground was sold for the construction of
	  shops (to prevent the Catholics from re-establishing ownership). So now the
	  Catholics gather each year at the Oude Kerk.</p>
	<p>Surrounding the church is the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Oudekerksplein");LangBoxJ("EN", "Old Church Square");</script>, the site of two pieces of art relating to the Red Light District:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A relief, by an anonymous artist (reportedly installed, unwitnessed, in
	    the middle of the night), of a hand feeling a woman&rsquo;s breast.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; a statue by Els R&#x0133;erse honoring sex workers, mounted on a
        pedestal that carries a plaque reading, <span class="dropnote">only in English</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>, &ldquo;Respect

<p>In 1578, shortly after taking control of the church from the Roman Catholics,
  the protestant leadership came down hard on what were, in their minds, unholy

	<p><img src="20090829/CoverPTD.jpg" class="PictureFloatLeft" />Here&rsquo;s a bit
	  of irony for you: When Musical Youth recorded their hit song in 1982, in
	  the throes of Nancy Reagan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Just Say No&rdquo; campaign and the Reagan
	  Administration&rsquo;s enthusiastic cheerleading for the War on Drugs, the group
	  felt it necessary to excise marijuana references from the lyrics. The song
	  was originally written as &ldquo;Pass
	  the Kouchie&rdquo; (an unambiguous cannabis reference, apparently), but became &ldquo;Pass
	  the Dutchie&ldquo; (an iron cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid) in this family-friendly
	  version.</p>

	<p>Little could Musical Youth imagine what the Dutch government might later do to undermine their efforts at purity: Fourteen years after their song was climbing the charts, the Netherlands established its 
	  	<script>LangBoxJ("NL", "gedoogbeleid");LangBoxJ("EN", "tolerance policy");</script>, which revised the guidelines related to its Opium Act: Going forward, the arrest and prosecution of persons possessing small quantities of drugs for personal use was not a priority. And with that a flag was planted on the slippery slope.</p>
	<p>It is still illegal, though not enforced, to consume marijuana in the Netherlands.
	  (The Dutch government explains this inconsistency by stating that it is
	  a party to several European treaties that forbid it to legalize marijuana,
	  so instead the country has established a policy that the laws will not
	  be enforced in limited situations [i.e., personal consumption in a reasonably
	  private environment].) It is still illegal <i>and enforced</i> that you cannot
	  grow marijuana in the Netherlands, cannot import it, and cannot trade it
	  in more than personal-consumption amounts. Yet somehow, the &ldquo;Coffeeshops&rdquo; (when
	  the name appears in English, it is a sign that marijuana is sold there)
	  are full of it. (The Dutch government does not explain <i>this</i> inconsistency,
	  but the obvious answer is that you can&rsquo;t have one without the other.) </p>
	<p>The situation now is such that phrase &ldquo;Dutch system&rdquo; is how diplomats describe a policy of turning a blind eye to casual drug use. And &ldquo;Dutchie&rdquo; has entered the English language as a type of marijuana cigar. It is not an exaggeration to say that nearly every single person among my friends, family, and co-workers, upon hearing that I had planned a trip to Amsterdam, asked as the first or second question, &ldquo;Are you going to smoke pot?&rdquo; And in a series of engagements that challenged my assumptions about age and religious conviction, many of them had stories, first- or second-hand, of marijuana consumption in Holland. </p>
	<p>So here&rsquo;s the answer: I went there thinking I might try it, as I don&rsquo;t have a strong moral objection to marijuana use &ndash; but
	  the Coffeeshops were so seedy and unappealing that I immediately changed my
	  mind. I never even walked inside of one. Yet I was not unaffected: Exactly
    opposite the (reported) experience of Bill Clinton, I didn&rsquo;t smoke, but I <i>did</i> inhale.
    The streets of Amsterdam are littered with Coffeeshops and the pot smoke
    billows constantly out of the doors and open windows of these establishments.
    And the effect was cumulative: By the third night, I found myself tossing
    and turning in bed, imagining every scenario of disaster for the remainder
    of our vacation; it was only when I realized that I was experiencing the
    paranoia of cannabis exposure that I finally relaxed enough to fall asleep.</p>
	<p>Frankly, by the end of our stay there, I got quite exasperated with the figurative and literal pot cloud hanging over Amsterdam. It&rsquo;s hard to find a T-shirt that doesn&rsquo;t have some drug reference on it.   And I searched high and low, without success, for a souvenir pair of wooden shoes. But if I&rsquo;d wanted a bong &ndash; even a bong shaped like wooden shoes &ndash; <i>thousands</i> of choices lay before me (and that is not hyperbole). And again, in ways that challenged my assumptions about age and religious conviction, I noticed the staff in these bong emporia: senior citizens, and women in headscarves, not being uncommon among them. </p>
