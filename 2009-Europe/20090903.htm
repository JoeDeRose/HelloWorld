<p>After our daily breakfast on goodies from the Boulangerie p&acirc;tisserie de la tour Eiffel (almond tarts and macaroons today), Mom, Billy, and I decided to start our day by visiting the icon that had been so central in Mom&rsquo;s choice of location for her apartment:  The 
	<script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Eiffel Tower");LangBoxJ("FR", "Tour Eiffel");</script>.</p>
<p>Now first the pedantry: It is true that the Eiffel Tower was the tallest structure in the world when it was completed in 1889 &#8211; but the persistent belief that it took that honor from the Great Pyramid in Giza is an example (among many unfortunate others) of the enthusiastic embrace of ignorance that plagues our culture. The facts are these:  The Great Pyramid lost its title to a series of taller and taller cathedrals, beginning in 1311 with Lincoln Cathedral in England. The cathedrals were superseded by the Washington Monument in 1884.  Then the Eiffel Tower held the title from 1889 to 1930, at which point it was surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York.</p>
<p>Even by Twenty-First-Century standards, however, the tower is no slouch in the height department, as you can see in the image at right comparing it with other buildings notable for the altitudes they achieve. But what it has in spades (and, in my view, more than any of the other buildings) is grace.</p>
<p>The French, of course, hated it at the start. For a people so steeped in beauty, they are notoriously incapable of perceiving it &#8211; and so, Gustave Eiffel was bombarded with vitriol at every turn, and luminaries as bright as &Eacute;mile Zola and Alexandre Dumas, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "fils");LangBoxJ("EN", "Jr.");</script> 
signed a wordy petition against the &#8220;odious column of riveted iron plates.&#8221; <span class="dropnote">Guy de Maupassant</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> is reputed to have eaten lunch in the tower&rsquo;s restaurant every single day, because it was the only place in Paris from which the tower itself could not be seen.</p>

<p>According to the plan, all of these critics should have been satisfied in 1909, when Eiffel&rsquo;s permit for the tower expired (it having been intended only to serve as an entrance arch to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Exposition Universelle");LangBoxJ("EN", "Universal Exposition");</script>, a World&rsquo;s Fair celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the storming of the Bastille). But by the time the demolition day came, France had found the tower useful as a communication mast, and demolition was postponed. Its utility to the scientific community was proved when cosmic rays were discovered in 1910 by comparing measurements taken at the tower&rsquo;s base with some taken at its apex. And its service to military signals in World War I earned it the status of a victory statue, and enshrined it as a permanent addition to the Parisian skyline.</p>
<p>When the German army advanced on Paris in World War II, the French made one of history&rsquo;s greatest contributions to the largely unexplored arena of passive-aggression in warfare:  The tower&rsquo;s elevator cables were cut so that Hitler would have to walk to the top. It was explained to the occupation forces that the parts necessary to repair the cables were impossible to obtain during the war, and Hitler stayed on the ground rather than face the indignity of climbing to the summit. Within hours of Paris&rsquo;s liberation, however, the elevators were working normally.</p>
<p>And they continue working normally to this day, especially after a substantial renovation to their works in the 1980s. So Mom, Billy, and I stood in the long, but fast-moving line at the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pilier nord");LangBoxJ("EN", "North Pillar");</script> to ride them. First came the slanted, two-story elevators that brought us to the second level. Then came the vertical elevator that brought us to the third level at the top.</p>
<p>From there, we walked the perimeter a couple of times, drinking in the views of Parisian sites both familiar and new.  And to our great delight we were able to distinguish Mom&rsquo;s apartment on the Avenue de la Bourdonnais a couple of streets over from the base of the tower. We also took note of Les Invalides, Sacr&eacute; C&oelig;ur, a gorgeous overview of the Champs de Mars, and the view across the Seine of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Palais de Chaillot");LangBoxJ("EN", "Chaillot Palace");</script> in the Trocad&eacute;ro. The Palais de Chaillot now houses a few second-tier museums, but it has an eminently noble past: It was in this building that the United Nations adoped the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and that NATO had its first home.</p>
<p>But the points of interest at the summit were not exclusively external: Though I had long forgotten about it after my previous visit to the tower twenty-eight years previous, there was also an office on that level that Gustave Eiffel had used to entertain visitors, which at this point was decorated with period furnishings and wax figures of, among others, Eiffel and Thomas Edison, as they might have sat during Edison&rsquo;s visit to the tower on September 10, 1889.</p>
<p>After enjoying the views from the top (but failing to fully enjoy the wind and cold), we went back to ground level &#8211; all of us on the vertical elevator to the second level, and then Mom and Billy by elevator while I made the descent by stairs through the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pilier est");LangBoxJ("EN", "East Pillar");</script> to get a better view of the ironwork. We planned to meet at the base of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pilier ouest");LangBoxJ("EN", "West Pillar");</script> (because I&rsquo;m a tad OCD, and this meant that after meeting yesterday at South, taking an elevator up North, and walking down East, I&rsquo;d had intercourse [not like that!] with all four pillars). We all arrived there at almost exactly the same moment.</p>
<p>Back on the ground, I noticed a feature of the tower that I did not recall from my previous visit to Paris &#8211; a list of names just below the first level:</p>
<div id="EiffelTowerNames" style="overflow:auto; white-space:nowrap; width:300px"><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold">SEGUIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LALANDE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRESCA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PONCELET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BRESSE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAGRANGE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BELANGER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CUVIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAPLACE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DULONG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHASLES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAVOISIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMPERE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHEVREUL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FLACHAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAVIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEGENDRE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAPTAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JAMIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GAY-LUSSAC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIZEAU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCHNEIDER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LE&nbsp;CHATELIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BERTHIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BARRAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DE&nbsp;DION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GO&Uuml;IN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOUSSELIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BROCA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BECQUEREL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CORIOLIS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAIL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIGER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIFFARD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PERRIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STURM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUCHY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BELGRAND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REGNAULT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FRESNEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DE&nbsp;PRONY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VICAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EBELMEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COULOMB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POINSOT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOUCAULT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DELAUNAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MORIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HA&Uuml;Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMBES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TH&Eacute;NARD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARAGO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POISSON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MONGE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PETIET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAGUERRE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WURTZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LE&nbsp;VERRIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PERDONNET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DELAMBRE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MALUS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BREGUET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POLONCEAU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DUMAS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLAPEYRON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BORDA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOURIER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BICHAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAUVAGE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PELOUZE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CARNOT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAM&Eacute;</span></div>
<p>Further research reassured me that this was not a failure of memory or observation: The seventy-two names had been painted over at the beginning of the twentieth century, and were only restored in the late 1980s, <i>after</i> the earlier trip Mom and I had made to Paris.</p>
<p>The list is of French scientists and engineers that Eiffel thought deserved recognition, and as with any such list it is controversial for its inclusions and omissions: Many feel that Henri Philibert Gaspard Darcy, Antoine Ch&eacute;zy, and Joseph Valentin Boussinesq are the most prominent names among unfortunate exclusions from the list &#8211; but the speculation for their absences are that Darcy&rsquo;s work was not widely used until the next century, Ch&eacute;zy was obscure, and Boussinesq was relatively young at the time. A less defensible exclusion is that of Sophie Germain, whose work on elasticity was not only of profound importance in general, but was essential to the construction of the Eiffel Tower itself. Eiffel&rsquo;s failure to include her suggests that his scope for this list was more narrow than he admitted, and that that gender was an undeclared requirement.</p>

<p>Next we made our way through a mid-morning drizzle to the <b>Bir Harkeim</b> M&eacute;tro station (named for a World War II battle in which the French held back the Nazis at a remote oasis in Libya) and rode on line 6 (one of the old lines, with tires instead of rails) to the <b>Charles de Gaulle &ndash; &Eacute;toile</b> station at the Arc de triomphe.</p>
<p>First we had lunch at a well-known but forgettable (and forgotten) Italian restaurant on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, and then commenced to climbing the famous arch.</p>
<p>The <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Arc de triomphe");</script> would be &#8211; but isn&rsquo;t &#8211; known in English as the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Triumphal Arch");</script>. More precisely, it is known as <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "l&rsquo;Arc de triomphe de l&rsquo;&Eacute;toile");LangBoxJ("EN", "The Triumphal Arch of the Star");</script> to distinguish it from the Arc de triomphe du Carrousel down the street. &#8220;Star,&#8221; here, refers to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place de l&rsquo;&Eacute;toile");LangBoxJ("EN", "Star Plaza");</script>, the historic name for what is now known as <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place Charles de Gaulle");LangBoxJ("EN", "Charles de Gaulle Plaza");</script>, where the Arc de triomphe sits. The historical name came from the star-like appearance on a map, or from the air, of the twelve streets radiating from the enormous roundabout that encircles the arch &#8211; emphasized by paving in the roundabout that puts a star-like triangle pointing in the direction of each branching street, a design element that dates back to 1777. It is this roundabout that invariably terrifies tourists, until they realize that a pedestrian tunnel along the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es takes them under the traffic and to the base of the arch. Drivers &#8211; both native and visitors &#8211; fear the roundabout as well, as it is the width of a ten-lane roadway, entirely without lines or traffic signals. And mishaps are so common in this interchange that French auto insurance agencies do not pay liability for accidents that occur here: Each driver is covered but by her or his own policy under what is known in the insurance trade as a &#8220;knock-for-knock agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy and Mom had been prepared to wait while I climbed to the top &#8211; but when we discovered that there was an elevator, they eagerly joined me. The elevator was interesting in itself: a semi-circular chamber that had been hollowed into part of one of the circular staircases.</p>
<p>The Arc de triomphe was commissioned in 1806 by Emperor Napol&eacute;on to commemorate those who fought for France, especially in the wars that he was at that time undertaking around Europe. When the arch was begun, his military brilliance seemed beyond dispute &#8211; but, unfortunately, history can&rsquo;t be written in the future tense, and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 cut French power so abruptly short, and contributed to such internal upheavals, that completion of the arch was, to understate the point, not a priority. Ironically, it was during the Bourbon restoration that the arch was finally completed in the mid-1830s &#8211; just in time for Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s body to pass underneath on its way to its final resting place at Les Invalides.</p>
<p>The Arc de triomphe is not, however, the first arch proposed for the site: In 1758, Charles Ribert proposed <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "l&rsquo;&Eacute;l&eacute;phant triomphal, grand kiosque &agrave; la gloire du roi");LangBoxJ("EN", "The Triumphal Elephant, Grand Kiosk of the King&rsquo;s Glory");</script> 
an elephant-shaped arch that would be entered via a spiral staircase in its belly, decorated with furniture that folded into the walls, and <span class="dropnote">drained</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> via piping that snaked through the elephant&rsquo;s trunk and landed in a fountain at street level.</p>
<table class="dropnoteframe">

					<td>It is not explained in the documentation that I have found what type of drainage would be necessary in a triumphal arch, especially one with a rounded roof that could not collect rainwater. But if they&rsquo;re talking about sewage, then I&rsquo;m appalled. But I think the elephant would have been really cool; there&rsquo;s an image to the right.</td>

<p>The top of the Arc de triomph gives the perfect view of Paris&rsquo;s <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Axe historique");LangBoxJ("EN", "Historical Axis");</script>, the series of monuments, gardens, plazas, and grand boulevards that runs in a straight line from the Louvre to the 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Grande Arche de la D&eacute;fense");LangBoxJ("EN", "Great Arch of La D&eacute;fense");</script> 
(named for its neighborhood, but also known as the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Grande Arche de la Fraternit&eacute;");LangBoxJ("EN", "Great Arch of Brotherhood");</script>&nbsp;). The Grande Arche is a fascinating structure, completed just twenty years previous to serve a dual geometric purpose: serving as an endpoint to the Axe historique, and creating a new axis with Paris&rsquo;s two tallest buildings &#8211; the Eiffel Tower and the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Tour Maine-Montparnasse");LangBoxJ("EN", "Maine-Montparnasse Tower");</script>. Like most of their prominent structures, the Parisians hated it at first &#8211; but only briefly; already they&rsquo;re quite fond of the Grande Arche now. The two sides of the Grande Arche house government offices; the top is an exhibition center; and the scaffolding in the middle is the guideway for elevator service to that exhibition center.</p>
<p>As you look at the Grande Arche in my pictures from the top of the Arc de triomphe, you will think that it looks slightly askew. This is not your imagination: The Grande Arche deviates from the Axe historique by <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "7.03 gon", true);MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "0.11 rad", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "6.33&deg;", false);</script>, and various explanations have their followers: One viewpoint holds that the angle was to give the arch a sense of depth when viewed from the Arc de triomphe. Another holds that it is turned slightly toward, and in honor of, its secondary axis with the Eiffel Tower and the Tour Maine-Montparnasse. The most romantic notion was that it&rsquo;s orientation was intended to mirror the similar angle of the Louvre at the opposite end of the Axe historique. But, while these benefits may have been noticed and appreciated by the architects, the fundamental reason is, alas, the least charming: The positions of the arch&rsquo;s foundations had to deviate from the Axe historique because of the extant rail lines and roadway below ground in that area.</p>
<p>Here, perhaps, it bears mention that the Arc de triomphe is the second largest triumphal arch in the world at <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "50 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "160'", false);</script> in height, <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "45 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "148'", false);</script> in width (as it faces the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es), and <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "22 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "72'", false);</script> 
in depth. The largest is in Pyongyang, North Korea &#8211; built intentionally to be slightly larger. Paris&rsquo;s Grande Arche is substantially bigger than either of them, however, and would easily be the largest triumphal arch in the world but for the issue of nomenclature: It is <i>just</i> an arch, not a <i>triumphal</i> arch. (A &#8220;triumphal arch&#8221; celebrates a wartime victory or ruler; the Grande Arche, by contrast, was conceived to celebrate humanitarian ideals.) Of course, that could change with the stroke of a pen. And the fact that it hasn&rsquo;t shows, at least to me, that the French can claim something the North Koreans lack &#8211; but it isn&rsquo;t the largest triumphal arch in the world.</p>
<p>When it came time to leave, Mom and Billy took the elevator down, but I wanted to use the stairs. This gave me some unanticipated pleasures, including seeing some statuary and a room dedicated to peace memorials. (Despite its inception, the Arc de triomphe is now much more about peace than it is about war.) At the bottom, I reconnoitered with them and we looked at France&rsquo;s <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Tombe du Soldat inconnu");LangBoxJ("EN", "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier");</script>, where (if Wikipedia is to be believed) the first eternal flame in Europe was lit in over 1500 years (after the extinguishment of the flame of the Vestal Virgins in 394).</p>
<p>Noticing that the face atop one of the sculptures adorning the arch matched a detail I saw on my way down through the center of the structure, I took a picture of it hoping to learn more later. And I have: The piece is Fran&ccedil;ois Rude&rsquo;s seminal work, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "<i>D&eacute;part des volontaires de 1792</i>");LangBoxJ("EN", "<i>Departure of the Volunteers of 1792</i>");</script>. The face that drew my attention is France, calling her citizens to war &#8211; such a pivotal image in the French psyche that it was once used as the official belt buckle of the Marshal of France, one of the highest military honors to which French generals can aspire. The sculpture is often referred to as <i>La Marseillaise</i> because it was this exact band of volunteers, from the southern French city of Marseille, who came to Paris in 1792 to join the forces of revolution singing the battle cry that eventually became the French national anthem. When their song began, it was known only as the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Chant de guerre pour l&rsquo;Arm&eacute;e du Rhin");LangBoxJ("EN", "War Song for the Army of the Rhine");</script>, but is has been known ever since as <i>La Marseillaise</i> in honor of these fighters and their hometown:</p>

<p>The first leg of our circuitous route home took us on a shopping errand a short way down that thoroughfare that runs in a straight line between the Arc de triomphe and the Louvre, known far and wide as the 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Avenue des Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es");LangBoxJ("EN", "Elysian Fields Avenue");</script>. This boulevard is named <i>after</i> the resting place in Greek mythology for vanquished heroes, and <i>because of</i> the pastoral environment through which it passed when <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Marie de M&eacute;dicis");LangBoxJ("IT", "Marie de&rsquo; Medici");</script> extended the garden axis of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Palais del Tuileries");LangBoxJ("EN", "Tuileries Palace");</script> into an avenue of trees &#8211; quite possibly the only thing for which she is fondly remembered.</p>
<p>One of the items in my bizarre assemblage of MP3s is &#8220;Aux Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es,&#8221; a song by Bernard Marly about this most famous street in the world. And as our trip to Europe approached, I found myself more and more excited each time this song would work its way to the top of my song shuffle:</p>

<p>What we wanted was relatively meager in comparison to the discovery of new love in Marly&rsquo;s song &#8211; but just looking for it, just having a reason to go shopping on this street (because it really <i>was</i> the most convenient place to go) gave us a similar sense of enthusiasm for where our lives had brought us.</p>
<p><img src="20090903/logoN.jpg" class="PictureFloatRight" />The item was a box of Nespresso cassettes.  Nespresso is an espresso machine made by the Nestl&eacute; corporation, which handles automatically all of the complicated functions of espresso preparation.  All you have to do is feed it a cassette and some water (and push the buttons at the right time, which involved a bit of trial and error), and a perfect cup of espresso is rendered (theoretically, at least; I&rsquo;m not a connoisseur). The cassettes came in a variety of shimmery nature colors, each of which could be compared against a chart to find out what levels of caffeine, what intensity of brew, and which flavor notes, it promised. They were outrageously expensive, of course, and the museum-like shop seemed more like a shrine to the technology than a vendor. All-in-all it would have been intimidating and off-putting except that the staff were so helpful. None of them spoke English well (which seemed a bit surprising considering the neighborhood &#8211; but I guess the regular tourist crowd doesn&rsquo;t have much need for espresso-machine supplies) &#8211; but their patience combined with my French got us through the selection and payment process without any major challenges.</p>
<p>Therefrom, we continued down the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to the Avenue George V, where Mom made a quick stop at the American Cathedral to familiarize herself with its location (as she had a missive to deliver &#8211; later in her stay &#8211; from her rector, who had worked with one of the functionaries there).</p>
<p>Farther down, we saw the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Flamme de la Libert&eacute;");LangBoxJ("EN", "Flame of Liberty");</script>, a gift in the shape of the Statue of Liberty&rsquo;s flame from Paris&rsquo;s <i>International Herald Tribune</i>, commemorating itself for publishing an English-language daily in Paris for 100 years (and counting), and also commemorating the work of two French businesses on restoration work for the Statue of Liberty on the occasion of its own centennial three years prior. The Flame&rsquo;s unfortunate location above the entrance to the Pont de l&rsquo;Alma Tunnel, where Princess Diana lost her life, has transformed it into a memorial for the Princess of Wales &#8211; so much so that anthropologist Guy Lesoeurs has observed that &#8220;Most people who come here think this was built for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there we crossed the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pont de l&rsquo;Alma");LangBoxJ("EN", "Alma Bridge");</script> &#8211; one of the major crossings over the Seine, named for a Franco-British victory in the Crimean War &#8211; and walked the short way back to Mom&rsquo;s apartment along a new route that introduced us to the wetlands exhibit behind the Mus&eacute;e du quai Branly.</p>

<p>While Mom and Billy rested, I walked over to see Les Invalides &#8211; which Mom insisted I had seen on the previous trip, but of which I had no memory whatsoever. I arrived just before closing, which cut short my sightseeing, but availed me of a discounted ticket.</p>
<p><script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Les Invalides");</script> translates to <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "The Invalids");</script> in English, but a little more explanation is necessary for this to make sense. Les Invalides is a complex (one might even say a <i>complex</i> complex) that institutionalizes France&rsquo;s attention to its military history &#8211; both living and symbolic. The broader name is taken from one of the components, a home for disabled war veterans known as 
<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "L&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel national des invalides");LangBoxJ("EN", "National Palace for Invalids");</script>, which comprises a retirement home and a sophisticated medical center.</p>
<p>It also comprises fifteen courtyards &#8211; including the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cour d&rsquo;honneur");LangBoxJ("EN", "Court of Honor");</script>, large enough for military parades &#8211; as well as several museums &#8211; notably the
<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Galerie royale des plans-relief");LangBoxJ("EN", "Royal Galery of Plans-Reliefs");</script> (a collection of topographic models wrested from the Louvre in 1777); the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Mus&eacute;e de l&rsquo;artillerie");LangBoxJ("EN", "Museum of Artillery");</script>; the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Mus&eacute;e historique de l&rsquo;arm&eacute;e");LangBoxJ("EN", "Historical Museum of the Army");</script>; and the multimedia presentation, 
<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "L&rsquo;Historial Charles-de-Gaulle");LangBoxJ("EN", "The Story of Charles de Gaulle");</script>. Inside Les Invalides proper is the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Eacute;glise Saint-Louis-des-Invalides ");LangBoxJ("EN", "St. Louis of Les Invalides Church");</script> &#8211; a chapel for the war veterans, daily attendance in which was once mandatory for residents. Joined at the altar to this chapel is the structure that most people think of when they say &#8220;Les Invalides,&#8221; but which is technically not part of the complex (although surrounded by it, sharing the same interior space without doors or barriers, and accessible with the same admission ticket): The <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Eacute;glise du d&ocirc;me");LangBoxJ("EN", "Church of the Dome");</script>, serving the royalty. This structure was of profound architectural significance to Louis XIV (the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Roi-Soleil");LangBoxJ("EN", "Sun King");</script>&nbsp;), who had it built: The royalty and the military were separate foundations, united at their fulcrum by the clergy.</p>
<p>The &Eacute;glise du d&ocirc;me is more necropolis than church. And the most spectacular interment, well beyond comparison, is that of Napol&eacute;on Bonabarte, styled Emperor as &#8220;Napol&eacute;on I&#8221; &#8211; sealed in a Russian matryoshka-like collection of sarcophagi: <span class="dropnote">Most, if not all,</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> of Napol&eacute;on lies in a tinplate coffin, surrounded by mahogany, enveloped by (not one, but) two coffins of lead, enrobed by ebony, and then by oak, and finally the gorgeous red porphyry that rests directly beneath the most prominent dome in Paris, the dome that many say is the most beautiful ever built by the French. The tomb rises <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "4.6 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "15'", false);</script> from the floor of the lower level &#8211; in glaring, possibly deliberate, contrast to the diminutive stature of the emperor himself, who measured just <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "157 cm", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "5'2&quot;", false);</script>. Even so, because the crypt is one level down and visible through a large oculus in the floor of the entry level, one looks down at the emperor rather than up; claims abound that this was an intentional device of the architects, to force visitors to bow to Napol&eacute;on, eternally, even in death.</p>

<p>Les Invalides was not Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s first burial site: He died, of course, in exile under the British at their remote territory of St. Helena in the middle of the South Atlantic. The conditions were bad by the standards expected for a conquered ruler (albeit pretty damn good by normal prison standards); that is to say, the house was damp and drafty. But damp and drafty did him in, or at least hastened his demise, and Napol&eacute;on died on May 5, 1821 and was buried in a grave on St. Helena. Disagreement over his name, whether it should include the surname &#8220;Bonaparte&#8221; as with a commoner, or read only &#8220;Napol&eacute;on&#8221; as with an emperor, were never resolved and the tombstone was left uninscribed. In 1840, the French obtained permission to retrieve his remains to France, and he was carried home in the ship <i>Belle-Poule</i>, painted black for this service. He rested in St. J&eacute;r&ocirc;me&rsquo;s Chapel for twenty-one years while the tomb at Les Invalides was completed. Finally, in 1861, he reached what is expected to be his final resting place.</p>
<p>The dome above him &#8211; plated in gold and recognized as one of the masterworks of French Baroque architecture &#8211; is interesting not only for its beauty, but also for its structure, and now for its history: When you look at the dome from outside the building, two rows of clerestory windows are prominent &#8211; but standing at Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s tomb, and looking up, only one of these rows can be seen. And the reason for this discrepancy will cause gnashing of the teeth for anyone who has ever worked for a mercurial and demanding boss: The Sun King entered the &Eacute;glise du d&ocirc;me upon completion (upon <i>completion</i>, mind you!) and looked up at the dome, and was displeased at the degree to which one had to crane one&rsquo;s neck to see the allegories painted by Charles de La Fosse on the dome&rsquo;s interior (in, by the way, the relatively new <script>LangBoxJ("IT", "sotto in s&ugrave;");LangBoxJ("EN", "seen from below");</script> style). And Louis XIV was not content merely to wish things were different; he wanted them fixed. The original plan was to lower the dome by, essentially, tearing down the main part of the structure and starting over. But the architects had the clever idea of leaving the first dome in place, and building a second dome lower than the first. That second dome had to be constructed in a challenging physical space, and La Fosse had to repeat his work, but the timetable was shortened, and the effect was pleasing to the king (and maybe to us; maybe Louis had a point).</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where the interesting history comes in: There&rsquo;s a gap between the lower and upper domes that people simply don&rsquo;t think about. And among the people who didn&rsquo;t think about it were the leaders of the Nazi occupation in World War II. But if they <i>had</i> thought about it, they would have secured a victory against the French Resistance, which was operating some of its functions in this gap. One imagines them working furtively in basements, secret rooms, and out-of-the-way offices at portside warehouses &#8211; but, in fact, some of their activities were taking place underneath a golden dome that was second only to the Eiffel Tower in height and was visible throughout the city.</p>
<p>I explored the &Eacute;glise du d&ocirc;me thoroughly, seeing Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s tomb from all angles, wandering through the crypts, and checking out a few other interments, noteworthy among them:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Napol&eacute;on II:</b> Napol&eacute;on Fran&ccedil;ois Joseph Charles Bonaparte, Duke of Reichstadt, was Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte&rsquo;s son and heir. He was designated at birth with the title &#8220;King of Rome,&#8221; a confusing designation that has its roots in the succession of heirs in the German-dominated <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Imperium Romanum Sacrum");LangBoxJ("DE", "Heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich");LangBoxJ("EN", "Holy Roman Empire");</script>, which ran from 962 CE-1806 CE and which was known after 1512 as the <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Imperium Romanum Sacrum Nationis Germanic&aelig;");LangBoxJ("DE", "Heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich Deutscher Nation");LangBoxJ("EN", "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation");</script>, which isn&rsquo;t to be confused with the <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Senatus Populusque Romanus (SPQR)");LangBoxJ("EN", "Senate and People of Rome");</script>, which is known popularly (and in history books) at the &#8220;Roman Empire.&#8221; (And that&rsquo;s just the set-up; we haven&rsquo;t even gotten to decrypting the title yet.)<br />
<br />
Napol&eacute;on I conquered the remaining shreds of the Holy Roman Empire, and modeled his his new empire on the Roman Empire (the un-&#8220;Holy&#8221; SPQR one), and, among these actions, applied the &#8220;King of Rome&#8221; title to his son, born in 1811. In the Holy Roman Empire, the real power rested in the person with the title <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Romanorum Imperator");LangBoxJ("DE", "R&ouml;misch-Deutscher Kaiser");LangBoxJ("EN", "Emperor of Rome");</script>; and in the First French Empire, similarly, it rested in the person known as <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "L&rsquo;Empereur des Fran&ccedil;ais");LangBoxJ("EN", "Emperor of the French");</script> &#8211; in both, <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Rex Romanorum");LangBoxJ("DE", "R&ouml;mischer K&ouml;nig");LangBoxJ("FR", "Roi de Rome");LangBoxJ("EN", "King of Rome");</script> was just a placeholder title for the heir (and often used to establish authority during the time between the death of the previous emperor and the actual coronation). Napol&eacute;on II had been known throughout his life as &#8220;King of Rome&#8221; &#8211; but he was actually made &#8220;Emperor of the French&#8221; in 1815 upon his father&rsquo;s abdication. But since this abdication happened in the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, and since his reign only lasted for sixteen days when he was five years old, perhaps Napol&eacute;on II feared that claiming &#8220;Emperor of the French&#8221; would open him to accusations of padding his r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Even so, he was also known, unambiguously, as &#8220;Duke of Reichstadt&#8221; after 1818 &#8211; but it is &#8220;King of Rome&#8221; that immortalizes him on his gravestone. This makes one wonder if Napol&eacute;on II went to his grave (of tuberculosis, at age 21) optimistic, but delusional &#8211; still thinking of himself as the heir to a future of power and glory.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned above, it is speculated that the architects constructed Napol&eacute;on I&rsquo;s tomb to force one to bow when looking at it. If this is so, they also did a bang-up job with Napol&eacute;on II&rsquo;s: Even though it is just a statue in the corner, its placement in relation to the doorway and chandelier forced me to, literally, prostrate myself to the statue to get a photograph. As with his father, most, but not all, of him is interred here: He died, and was first buried, in Vienna. None other than Adolph Hitler made a gift of his remains to the French government in 1840 on the hundredth anniversary of the return of his father&rsquo;s remains from St. Helena. But interment customs for nobility in Vienna were such that the body, heart, and viscera were buried separately. The body was returned to Paris, but the heart remains in Vienna&rsquo;s <script>LangBoxJ("DE", "Herzgruft");LangBoxJ("EN", "Heart Crypt");</script> (Urn 42), and his viscera remain in its Ducal Crypt (Urn 76).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ferdinand Foch:</b> Foch (&nbsp;<script>LangBoxJ("IPA", "/fʌʃ/");</script>, rhymes with &#8220;rush&#8221;) has, in my view, the most stately tomb in Les Invalides. He also has the tragic distinction of being right: A brilliant military strategist, Foch argued at the end of World War I for terms that would prevent future German hostility against France. When his warnings were ignored, and the Treaty of Versailles was ratified with terms that neither pacified nor substantially weakened Germany, Foch expressed his contempt for the document, saying, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;Ce n&rsquo;est pas une paix, c’est un armistice de vingt ans&nbsp;&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;This is not a peace; it is an armistice for twenty years&#8221;");</script>. Tragically, he was correct, almost to the day: The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919; Nazi Germany invaded Poland (generally considered the start of World War II) on September 1, 1939 &#8211; 20 years and 65 days later.</li>

<p><img src="20090903/LogoCC.jpg" class="PictureFloatRight" />After returning from Les Invalides, I volunteered to go on a grocery run to pick up toiletries, cleaning supplies, and nibbles. The nibbles were easy enough, as I could just wander around the store and pick out things that looked good &#8211; but the other items were quite a challenge, and the translation dictionary in my PDA came up with terms that the employees in the store (whose native language, I believe, was not French &#8211; nor, of course, English) could not recognize. The other customers weren&rsquo;t much more help. And the task was complicated by the fact that I started my efforts at the Carrefour City store (the green &#8211; as in color, not necessarily sustainability &#8211; grocery store), which was a recent addition to the local shopping scene. The place was teeming with shoppers, but as for myself I found it unbearably chaotic, dirty, and distressing, and got out as quickly as possible while struggling to understand a process that was similar, but not identical, to what I knew from home (e.g., I handed them my credit card at the wrong time and didn&rsquo;t initially understand that I needed to be bagging my own groceries as they came down the conveyor). Part of the problem, I learned later, was that this store had literally opened the previous day &#8211; and everyone in the neighborhood was apparently eager to try it.</p>
<p><img src="20090903/LogoF.jpg" class="PictureFloatRight" />Alas, I was notified upon my return that some items had been left off the shopping list. But instead of returning to the execrable Carrefour City, I went to the March&eacute; Franprix (the red grocery store) around the corner. It, by contrast, was an oasis of calm and civility (with, I must add, comparable prices) &#8211; and I returned to the apartment with instructions for Mom that she and her guests should use it exclusively, and avoid Carrefour City at all costs.</p>
<p>For all the shopping, though, we didn&rsquo;t buy dinner in the grocery stores. Instead, we went to a nearby restaurant where I had a dinner of <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "tartare &agrave; fa&ccedil;on basque");LangBoxJ("EN", "steak tartare in the Basque style");</script>. On the previous and subsequent days, I had steak tartare more dinners than not, as it is one of my favorite meals, and was much easier to find in Paris than at home &#8211; but the Basque version was new to me, with a slightly spicier presentation and roasted red bell peppers. I can attest that it was fantastic.</p>
