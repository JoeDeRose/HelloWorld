	<p><img src="20090901/2HLogo.png" class="PictureFloatLeft" />We set our alarm for 5:00 AM and skulked off the Vita Nova at the crack of dawn (as we had told our hosts to expect). Having arisen before the buses started running, we hoofed it over to Amsterdam Centraal, confirmed that our train was expected on track 13B, and went there to wait.</p>
	<p>Despite the fact that its point of origination was Amsterdam, the train didn&rsquo;t pull into the station until just a few minutes before departure. But we quickly made out way on board and found our carriage and seat &ndash; no small achievement as the ticket was written entirely in Dutch. But with some quick cross-checking between my ticket and Billy&rsquo;s we were able to deduce that <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "R&#x0133;tuig");</script> meant <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "carriage");</script> and <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "zitplaats");</script> meant <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "seat");</script> (but why the first of these words is capitalized and the second is not, is a mystery of the language that I have not yet penetrated).</p>
	<p>Waiting for the train, we were fascinated (surprisingly fascinated, actually) to see a Cuba tourism advert. The picture is at right, and the caption reads, <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "&bdquo;Verrassend anders! Heeft u al geboekt?&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Surprisingly different! Have you already booked?&rdquo;");</script>. Questions about Cuba actually came up a few times as we were talking with locals in the places we visited. Apparently they are acutely aware that we American are not allowed to go there, and that quite a number of us nonetheless yearn to do so.</p>
	<p>Thalys is the go-to method for getting between Paris and Benelux. Predicated on the existence of this service, Air&nbsp;France even ceased its air connection between Paris and Brussels; instead, it has (along with American Airlines and Northwest Airlines) a code-share arrangement with Thalys &ndash; which has got to cause a huge amount of confusion to people booking a flight to Brussels for which they think they&rsquo;re changing planes in Paris. And though it has no air service of any kind, it has even been assigned an IATA (International Air Transport Association) code: <b>2H</b>.</p>
	<p>Despite being billed as a high-speed system, the train lumbered through the Low Countries, never building up anything like the speed it was designed for in between its stops at:

<p>Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve actually spent some quality time in Belgium &ndash; albeit not recently: It was almost two-thirds of my life ago, when I was sixteen. But it happened.</p>
<p>Billy, on the other hand, has only been there on the way to somewhere else &ndash; changing planes at BRU twice in 2003, and now passing through by train. So he has to argue with people (if he so chooses) as to whether he&rsquo;s even been to Belgium or not.</p>
<p>I am of the conviction that he has (and that we both were on this trip). My position on the subject is that if you can have the following conversation with somebody ...</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>Me:</b> Hey, dude, what country are we in?</p>
	<p><b>Them:</b> Why, you&rsquo;re in Belgium, mate! Would you like a <span class="dropnote">waffle</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and if they are not (A) lying, (B) insane, or (C) mistaken, that you have been to Belgium.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a prevalent belief among my friends that if you have not given birth to a child in the country (or spent the night, or whatever), that you have not been to the country in question. I say this to them: Next time you&rsquo;re changing planes in Brussels, pull out a handgun and start shooting at the ceiling. Then, when the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Politie");</script> come to get you, say, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t arrest me. I&rsquo;m not even <i>in</i> Belgium!&rdquo; Let me know if it works. Better yet, send me the video; I&rsquo;ll put in on YouTube for you.</p>

					of which Prussia was at that time a component); it used the French Franc as its currency even though it did not border with, or have any ties to, France; and it was largely left to its own devices, except when Belgium and Prussia (usually Belgium) thought it was getting out of line, such as when it began to produce its own stamps, set up a casino, and welcome people fleeing military service obligations. The foray into Esperanto was the brainchild of a local booster, Dr. Wilhelm Molly, and actually gained some traction in the early 20th century, with Neutral Moresnet being declared by the

Unfortunately, the German tide that washed over the continent in World War I scuttled the ambitions of Neutral Moresnet and Esperantists, with the territory being absorbed into Germany when they were winning, and into Belgium after they had lost. Neutral Moresnet is also of interest to cartographers, being one of the components of the only international quadripoint ever to exist, at the point where the Netherlands, Belgium, Prussia, and Neutral Moresnet came together (the same point where the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany now come together).</td>

<p>I find the lions in the coat of arms especially cool because of their long and entrenched association with the region. As noted above, all of the components of Belgium from which the flag derived its colors were represented by lions. And the tie between the beast and the land is so entrenched that old maps of what we now think of (more or less) as Benelux were often drawn in the shape of 
	<script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Leo Belgicus");LangBoxJ("EN", "the Netherlandic Lion");</script>.</p>
<p>For this to make sense, it is essential to decrypt some of the vocabulary: Today we think of Belgium as the southern major component of Benelux, and the Netherlands as the northern major component (and Luxembourg as the carbuncle at the southeast corner) &ndash; but it was not always so: Although 20th-century Latin has adjusted to reflect modern-day political borders, historically, the word 
	<script>LangBoxJ("LA", "&laquo;Belgica&raquo;");</script> was just Latin for &ldquo;the Netherlands.&rdquo; It is for this reason that maps in the form of <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Leo Belgicus");</script> comprise the entirety of the Low Countries.</p>

All I can tell you is that the following is what I have now: The definitive heritage of the tricolor is unknown, but the colors have been associated with France since the Middle Ages. White is often associated with the monarchy, and some interpret the flag as an overlay of the monarchy&rsquo;s white on the blue and red, a long-time symbol of Paris. Others take blue to represent the bourgeoisie, white to represent the clergy, and red to represent the nobility (with blue coming first, in keeping with the ideals of the French Revolution). Yet others say that blue comes from the House of Valois, white from Joan of Arc, and red from either St. Martin or St. Denis (or both). Whatever its history, the flag is an inviolable symbol of France: When a royalist majority was voted in at the beginning of the Third Republic, the parliament made preparations to re-establish the monarchy, and even went so far as to offer the throne to Henri, comte de Chambord. He accepted on the condition that the tricolor be replaced by a white flag. The demand was refused, and neither Henri, nor anyone else, was ever again named King of France.</td>

									<td class="CountryDescrip">Apparently the thing you see above is not a coat of arms &ndash; at least not according to the anal-retentives who decide these things &ndash; but, rather, a &ldquo;national emblem.&rdquo; The difference, apparently, is whether the governmental force that it represents is democratically elected (national emblem) or hereditary (coat of arms). But this is bullshit: Ireland&rsquo;s version is considered a coat of arms, and it was registered in 1945, well after any king ruled that country. Anyway, I could edit Wikipedia, but I can&rsquo;t argue with it &ndash; so there it is, the &ldquo;national emblem&rdquo; of France. Those two cuddly creatures are a lion and an eagle (and they&rsquo;re even more adorable on a <a href="20090901/CoatOfArmsFranceLarge.png">large version</a>). the leaves are laurel (victory) and oak (wisdom). And that thing down the middle is the fasces, an axe tied together with a bundle of sticks (symbolizing strength through unity). It is the symbol from which &ldquo;fascism&rdquo; took its name, but its use in this context predates the despicable political movement of the early 20th century. It was, however, used in the despicable context on some versions of the French flag during the time that the Vichy government controlled France as puppets of the Third Reich.</td>

This system of timekeeping arose in the same context in which the <span class="dropnote">French adopted</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Metric System");LangBoxJ("FR", "Syst&egrave;me international d&rsquo;unit&eacute;s");</script>.</p>

					<td>It is widely believed that the French invented the metric system after their revolution, to remove anthropic measurements based on the size of the monarch&rsquo;s foot, thumb, etc. This is actually not true, as the metric system was conceived over a century prior to the French Revolution as an aid to international commerce (the &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; of its day, as it were), and the path to its eventual adoption in France was, in fact, rooted in the work of Louis&nbsp;XVI, the very king that the Revolution so famously beheaded in 1793. But even though hatred of monarchy didn&rsquo;t play too much a role in establishing the metric system as the new standard, it did affect the measurements themselves: Originally, &ldquo;gram&rdquo; was just a shorthand term for a thousandth of a &ldquo;grave,&rdquo; the latter being the base unit of measurement of mass. But 
						<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;grave&nbsp;&raquo;");</script> was also the word for the title of nobility that translates to English as <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;count&rdquo;");</script>. Because any reminder of the nobility was out of favor in revolutionary France, the base term for units of mass became the gram, and the mass represented by the term &ldquo;grave&rdquo; would forever be just a thousand grams, or a &ldquo;<span class="PictureCaptionRoman">kilo</span>gram.&rdquo; But even though this change affected the base <span class="PictureCaptionRoman">term</span>, it did not affect the base <span class="PictureCaptionRoman">unit</span>. And that is why, at the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Bureau international des poids et mesures");LangBoxJ("EN", "International Bureau of Weights and Measures");</script>, there exists, entombed under two nested bell jars, not the &#8220;international prototype of the <span class="PictureCaptionRoman">gram</span>,&#8221; but, rather, the &#8220;international prototype of the <span class="PictureCaptionRoman">kilogram</span>.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The French did, however, create the Republican calendar out of whole cloth after the Revolution in the same spirit of enthusiastic change around new systems of measurements. And interestingly, it was the calendar that came first, having been adopted in 
<script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "An II", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "1793 CE", false);</script>; the process toward metrication began the same year, but the system wasn&rsquo;t wholly adopted in France until six years later, in <script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "An VIII", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "1799 CE", false);</script>.</td>

<p>Today&rsquo;s date, as you can see, is &laquo;&nbsp;<b>Jour de la truite; quintidi, 15 fructidor, an CCXVII</b>&nbsp;&raquo;. Let&rsquo;s break that down backward:</p>
<p>&laquo;&nbsp;<b>An CCXVII</b>&nbsp;&raquo; is the year. It means that 217 years have elapsed since the day that the First French Republic came into being on <script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "1 vend&eacute;miaire, an I", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "September 22, 1792", false);</script>.</p>
<p>&laquo;&nbsp;<b>15 fructidor</b>&nbsp;&raquo; is the date and month.

<p>&laquo;&nbsp;<b>Quintidi</b>&nbsp;&raquo; is the weekday, and may reflect the most important reason for the calendar&rsquo;s fairly quick demise: The thirty-day month was divided into three 10-day <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "d&eacute;cades");</script>, with the final day being a day of rest. So the French bourgeoisie found themselves having fought a revolution that converted their weeks from seven days &ndash; with one day of rest &ndash; to ten days &ndash; but still with only <i>one</i> day of rest. Needless to say, they didn&rsquo;t like the math. For what it&rsquo;s worth, the days are as follows:</p>

<p>&laquo;&nbsp;<b>Jour de la truite</b>&nbsp;&raquo; is the day of the year. In the Republican Calendar, there was actually a name for all 366 days of the year.

<p>This highlights one of the unfortunate truths that would have plagued the French populace had the calendar survived: You might have been born on &ldquo;Beauty of the Night,&rdquo; except that your mother&rsquo;s water broke early and you took your first breath on &ldquo;Day of the Ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p><script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Jour de la truite");</script>, by the way, means <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Day of the Trout");</script> (which sounds like the title of a movie that could exist in any number of genres, but would be awful in all of them).

<p>The second design element that is worth mentioning is the location indicators for Paris, such as you see at the beginning of the &ldquo;Gare du nord&rdquo; section, immediately below. This design, now over 150 years old, is inextricably tied to Paris, as much an emblem of France&rsquo;s capital as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe. Although different designs are employed in real life, depending on the age of the sign, the importance of the location, and the length of the name, the one I have emulated is the most iconic, with the name of the arrondissement at the top and the name of the location in bold below (with smaller letters for connecting words). The colors are enshrined by law as &ldquo;azur blue background&rdquo; and &ldquo;green bronze framing&rdquo; (and there&rsquo;s also some stuff about size and shadowing). If you actually want to make one, and get it right, the very precise, but not very romantic, substance description is also in the legal code: blue copper phtalocyanate (C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>8</sub>Cu) and green chrome oxide (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</p>

	<p>I had a romanticized notion of what it would be like to arrive in Paris&rsquo;s 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Gare du nord");LangBoxJ("EN", "North Station");</script> 
	by train: The engine and carriages would coast into the cavernous terminal, bathed in light from the sunlight dappling through the clerestory windows above the platforms. Mom would be waiting for me and Billy by the Thalys sign. Having somehow come into possession of a hat, I would toss it in the air &agrave; la Mary Tyler Moore. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure a flock of bluebirds would handle my luggage.</p>
<p>So I was already disappointed when I realized that it was raining as we approached Paris &ndash; but I thought, &ldquo;At least we can be thankful that the station is covered, and that the bluebirds will take care of the luggage.&rdquo; So my disappointment was enormously compounded when the train lurched to a stop about a block from the Gare du nord because there were already several Thalys trains parked on the Thalys platforms. We and the other passengers had to get out and make the last leg of the trip in the rain along concrete walkways to the station. (And, as you may have surmised, there were no bluebirds.)</p>
	<p>Mom was indeed there waiting for us &ndash; but in an anxious state, having had her own set of ordeals getting from the airport down to the station. I had hoped that she would be able to arrive early and spend a couple of hours at leisure in the neighborhood shops and caf&eacute;s, cherishing the excitement of her first morning in Paris. But jet lag was hitting her hard and apparently it had taken all of her time and all of her patience just to get there at all.</p>
	<p>But even though my imagination was way better than the reality of the thing, I can&rsquo;t really complain about the Gare du nord. It served our needs as designed (except, maybe, for the part about not keeping us dry). And it is a phenomenal transportation megaplex: With 40 platforms, two M&eacute;tro lines, two RER lines, a busy bus platform, a taxi zone, and vehicle parking, it processes <span class="dropnote">180 million passengers per year</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>, making it the third-busiest railway station in the world, and the busiest outside Japan.</p>

<p>Interestingly, one of the things that saved Paris from destruction in World War II was this complicated station system. Much as all roads are said to lead to Rome, all railroads lead <i>to</i> &ndash; but not <i>through</i> &ndash; Paris. Many European cities faced immense destruction around their train stations as the Allies or the Axis bombed those areas to interrupt the delivery of supplies. But Paris, with only <i>terminal</i> stations serving its long-distance routes, was not capable of serving as a transit point, and therefore was not a <span class="dropnote">strategic military target</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> for either side.</p>

	<p>As you may already know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of public transit. So I was delighted when Mom&rsquo;s contacts for the apartment recommended bus 42 as the way to get from the Gare du nord to the residence. Apparently, the M&eacute;tro and RER stations are all several blocks away &#8211; but bus 42 runs from the Gare du nord to the front door. It&rsquo;s also well known as a Tourist bus, in that it passes quite a number of the famous sites of Paris, notably, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "l&rsquo;Op&egrave;ra");LangBoxJ("EN", "the Opera");</script>, Place de la Concorde, the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, the Seine, and the Eiffel Tower.</p>
	<p>I have always found the French delightful &#8211; cheerful, eager to help, and accommodating. The vast majority of French people with whom I have interacted have switched the conversation to English as soon as they recognized my nationality (even while apologizing, unnecessarily, for their own lack of skill in English), have found something nice to say about Americans and America (even in the most politically trying of times), and have gone out their way to assist me if I were lost or confused. I have never understood the prejudice that some Americans have about the French, as I have never seen even one single example of the stereotypical rude Parisian, and have seen countless counterexamples. If I were forced to come up with a complaint, it is that they don&rsquo;t give me a chance to practice my French, as they are so unfailingly eager to switch to English if they know even just a little of it. No one in any country was mean-spirited to us on this trip, but one person made an anti-American jab in the Netherlands (&#8220;You&rsquo;re from America; well, we all have our handicaps&#8221;), as did one couple in Ireland (&#8220;The seas are too rough for a landing? Blame the Americans [looking at us] for the global warming&#8221;) &#8211; so I think it&rsquo;s important to note that we never heard such grating comments while in France. This is even more revealing in light of the timeline: We were in the Netherlands and Ireland for three days each, while we spent <i>six</i> days in Paris alone. And to boot, we interacted with more locals in Paris than in either of the other two countries. And that, in part, that&rsquo;s why you won&rsquo;t hear an anti-French commentary from me.</p>
	<p>This pleasant trend was in evidence from the moment of our arrival in Paris, in the person of one of the other passengers on bus 42: She greeted us and welcomed us to Paris as soon as she heard us speaking English. She commented (blissfully unaware of the prejudice, I hope) that we would love Paris because the people are so friendly, and then added that she had been to the U.S. twice and found Americans to be quite friendly as well. And she helped me with my pronunciation of &#8220;Monttessuy,&#8221; our destination &#8211; which was helpful because I had not been able to pronounce it correctly when I asked if the bus went there, so instead I confirmed with the driver that it went by the nearby Eiffel Tower. Thus, when he called back (out of kindness, without being asked) to let us know that the Eiffel Tower stop was approaching, I had the vocabulary I needed to thank him and let him know that our actual destination was Monttessuy.</p>
<script>
WriteParisSignJ(7, "Avenue ((de)) la Bourdonnais");

	<p>So we hopped off the bus at Monttessuy and made our way to 17 avenue de la Bourdonnais, the address of the building in which Mom would be spending her month in Paris. We made our way up to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "5<sup><u>e</u></sup> &eacute;tage");LangBoxJ("EN", "5th floor");</script>, the <script>MeasurementBoxJ("BR/EU", "5th story", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US/NA", "6th story", false);</script> 
		of the building, and were met by one of the representatives who introduced us to the beautiful <span class="dropnote">two-bedroom</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> apartment, and who showed us how to work the somewhat complicated lock and appliances. Unfortunately, we neglected to ask about the shower, which we later learned exhibited the typical whimsical relationship that Europeans have with their plumbing fixtures.</p>

	<p>We got our first view of the Eiffel Tower (not including seeing it from a distance on the bus) in the courtyard of Mom&rsquo;s apartment.

	<p>After getting our bearings in the apartment, I left Billy and Mom there while I went up to Charles de Gaulle airport to pick up Mom&rsquo;s luggage, which she had left at a baggage storage agency in the airport&rsquo;s Terminal 2D. This was a plan that we had laid out from the start so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to lug a big suitcase around Paris while waiting for our train to arrive from Amsterdam.</p>
	<p>I like the Paris M&eacute;tro quite a bit, but, unfortunately, the trip to Charles de Gaulle put me on the RER &#8211; <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "R&eacute;seau express r&eacute;gional");LangBoxJ("EN", "Regional Express Network");</script> 
		&#8211; Paris&rsquo;s commuter rail system, which is much more extensive than the M&eacute;tro (hence my need to use it) and, in my opinion, much more cumbersome.	Part of my frustration with the RER, I will concede, was simple lack of familiarity. And most of my frustration had to do with Line C (the first leg of my trip), as Line B, with its airport traffic, had enhancements that made travel easier on the unfamiliar tourist.</p>
	<p>The problem with RER Line C is that it is a &#8220;line&#8221; in the same sense that an octopus is a &#8220;line.&#8221; On the RER map, Line C is everything colored in yellow, a mass-transit conglomeration that encompasses seven terminal stations (some of which are also intermediary stations, served apparently by different tracks, on other branches of Line C), in three major constituents:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines</b> (C7) to either
<ul>
		<li><b>Dourdan-la-For&ecirc;t</b> (C4) or</li>
				<li><b>Saint-Martin d&rsquo;&Eacute;tampes</b> (C6);</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Versailles &#8211; Rive Gauche</b> (C5) to <b>Versailles &#8211; Chantiers</b> (C8); and</li>
		<li><b>Pontoise</b> (C1) to <b>Massy &#8211; Palaiseau</b> (C2)</li>
	</ul>
<p>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that end-point C3 is missing. Apparently it was once associated with the station <b>Argenteuil</b> on a line that&rsquo;s no longer supported (an odd withdrawal for a system only thirty years old) &#8211; but the code may be reinstated as part of an expansion plan deeper into the suburbs, which will not only add C3 at a place across town from the original C3, but which will also also remove C8. So much like the octopus to which I&rsquo;ve already compared it, Line C can have a leg cut off, and simply re-grow it in a different direction with no damage.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really confusing about Line C is these component lines listed above.  For the second one, the end point stations are literally down the street from each other just over <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "1 km", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "0.6 mi.", false);</script>
    distant, both in the way-suburban <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "zone tarifaire");LangBoxJ("EN", "fare zone");</script> 
    4 (out of 6 such zones), but covering an enormous loop through central Paris between them; you could walk on your knees between the stations faster than you could take a train from one to the other. But other extremes of the line are at vast distances: The route from <b>Pontoise</b> (C1) to <b>Saint-Martin d&rsquo;&Eacute;tampes</b> (C6) (which, I acknowledge, would require a transfer) is 
    <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "94.1 km", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "58.5 mi.", false);</script>. The upshot of all this branching is that RER Line C is an enormous complex that comprises 84 stations on <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "185.6 km", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "115.3 mi.", false);</script> 
of track, but only 11 of those stations are on a segment that all the trains share.</p>
<p>So one faces a challenge in knowing which train will go to one&rsquo;s destination (more so since some trains skip some stations). The governing authority has tried to decrypt these arcana in a way that can only be described as Kafkaesque: Each train has a four-letter 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "nom de mission");LangBoxJ("EN", "service name");</script>. The first letter of the name signifies the train&rsquo;s destination; the second letter indicates which group of stations it serves (&#8220;O&#8221; means &#8220;omnibus,&#8221; and signifies that <i>all</i> stations are covered); the third and fourth letters are arbitrarily selected to complete the word (usually matching a person&rsquo;s name, but, oddly, often reflecting English-language name forms, such as &#8220;VICK,&#8221; or English words, such as &#8220;FOOT&#8221;). I didn&rsquo;t understand the system at the time, and I&rsquo;m still not certain whether I got on the appropriate trains by luck (although, if so, on the busy segment that I was traveling the odds were heavily in my favor) or if every single train serves the two stations I was using. But (if I&rsquo;d already climbed this learning curve) I could have consulted a sign in the station to confirm (on the return trip, for example) that the <b>Pont de l&rsquo;Alma</b> station was served in that direction by the following trains:</p>
<ul>

<p>Separate notices would alert me whether the train at a particular time was long or short, so I could even stand at the appropriate part of the platform.</p>
<p>My point, if I&rsquo;ve got one at all, is that this is freakishly complicated &#8211; and not just for me, but for them: A delay anywhere in the system throws the whole of Line C into disarray, and they&rsquo;ve got a separate group of service names (BAJI, LOLA, SVEN, and TORA) that only come into play when everything else is frakked up.</p>
<p>But while I&rsquo;m complaining about the organizational management of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "R&eacute;gie autonome des transports parisiens");LangBoxJ("EN", "Autonomous Operator of Parisian Transports");</script>, I have to praise their aesthetics. The RAPT has what I consider to be one of the best logos in the world. It echoes the shape of the Seine River, transformed into a face and looking optimistically upward, framed by a circle that can represent the sun, the moon, or the almost-circular city limits of Paris.</p>
<p>Anyway, I made it work. The train ride was a burden, at over an hour each way, but the highlight was seeing the enormous, and enormously beautiful, Terminal 2 at Charles de Gaulle. I thought I had a sense of it from when Billy and I transferred here on our way back from the Middle East, but I had never before seen the soaring, grand architecture that I saw while picking up Mom&rsquo;s luggage.</p>
<p>On the way back, I had the chance to chat with a local woman and to ask her about the word &#8220;l&egrave;s,&#8221; which had confused me when I noticed it in the name of the end-point station, <b>Saint-R&eacute;my-l&egrave;s-Chevreuse</b> (B4). The word looked like the plural definite article, but carried an accent mark that I had never seen in this context. She seemed impressed at my attention to detail, commenting that she had never noticed this herself despite using the train with some regularity, and then explained that it was a form of the definite article that appears only in very old text.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a good time for my confession that I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the sound of French (although I am very please that I am able to speak it). The nearly universal opinion is that it is at or near the top of the list for the world&rsquo;s most beautiful languages, but mine is the vote that keeps that opinion from being unanimous. I adore the French, their nation, and their food &#8211; but their language to my ears sounds like a malfunctioning contraption in a Dr. Seuss book. Among the languages I speak, I&rsquo;d put its euphony only slightly above German.</p>
<p>Finally, I made it back to the apartment and turned my attention to deciphering the shower mechanism. Luckily for me, Billy had been at this for two hours, alternately freezing and scalding his skin, and was able to help me use it with minimal injury and discomfort.</p>

<p>After I got myself cleaned up, we went out to see the neighborhood &ndash; around the Eiffel Tower toward the western end of the seventh <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "arrondissement");LangBoxJ("EN", "administrative district");</script>. The arrondissements of Paris are, on their surface, simple administrative divisions that (among other things) localize the <span class="dropnote">postal code</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. But they are core to the self-perception, and external perception, of Paris. And even on a map they are somewhat romanticized &#8211; spiraling outward from the Louvre like the widening gyre of a falcon taking flight, or like the golden spiral of the shell of a perfectly formed snail. On the ground you might have no clue when you cross from the 15th arrondissement into the 7th &#8211; but when you&rsquo;re making your hotel reservation, you&rsquo;d never get them confused.</p>

<p>The Tower, of course, was the money shot. But I was also quite impressed with the fantastic architecture of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Mus&eacute;e du quai Branly");LangBoxJ("EN", "Quai Branly Museum");</script>, notably its <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;mur v&eacute;g&eacute;tal&nbsp;&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;vegetal wall&rdquo;");</script> &ndash; a sheer vertical surface with 15,000 plants, in 150 different species, nourished by a drip-irrigation system at the ceiling level. It is the brainchild of artist and scientist Patrick Blanc, and serves not only the goals of forward-thinking architecture, but also those of the environmental movement, as the plants protect the building&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade and insulate its interior.</p>
<p>Then, realizing our hunger, we went out for dinner in a neighborhood bistro. I had steak tartare for the first of several times during our stay in Paris &#8211; every single one of which, my order was met with the confirmation, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;Vous savez que c&rsquo;est cru, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?&nbsp;&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s raw, right?&rdquo;");</script>. Indeed I did, and it was delicious.</p>
<p>Back  in the room, we repaired to the laundry room at sunset to watch the hourly light show on the Eiffel Tower, and then to our respective beds for the night.</p>
