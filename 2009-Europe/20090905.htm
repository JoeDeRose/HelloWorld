</script>
<p>At the absolute top of my must-see list for Paris was the cemetery that is known officially as the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cimeti&egrave;re de l&rsquo;Est");LangBoxJ("EN", "East Cemetery");</script>, but which is known to the world as <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re-Lachaise");LangBoxJ("EN", "Cemetery of Father Lachaise");</script> &#8211; named for the confessor to the Sun King, P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Aix de La Chaise, and probably more famous than any other burial ground on our planet.</p>
<p>Mom and I started our day taking Bus 69 from her apartment over to the cemetery&rsquo;s <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Porte Gambetta");LangBoxJ("EN", "Gambetta Entrance");</script> <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap01.png' class='InlineGraphic' />, passing along the way the striking <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Colonne de Juillet");LangBoxJ("EN", "July Column");</script> in the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place de la Bastille");LangBoxJ("EN", "Bastille Square");</script>. Sitting at the former location of the notorious prison that fell to the ground along with the House of Bourbon, you&rsquo;d think that the column might commemorate the fall of a king in the revolution of 1789 &#8211; but, in fact, it celebrates the establishment of one in the revolution of 1830, when Louis-Philippe took the throne as (though he surely did not anticipate this) the last King of France. The column is composed of 21 brass drums, weighing <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "74,000 kg", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "163,000 lbs.", false);</script>, and rising <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "47 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "154'", false);</script>. It contains the cremated remains of many of the victims of that revolution in its base.</p>
<p>As a prominent square, this site captured the imagination of those in power long before the July Column was realized: Initial plans were for a different column to commemorate the fall of the Bastille. And if you have read <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>, you may recall an incident in which Gavroche takes refuge in an enormous crumbling plaster elephant. The story may have come from Victor Hugo&rsquo;s imagination, but the elephant did not: It was thus and it was here. Napol&eacute;on wished to create a giant bronze elephant on this site from the melted weaponry of his enemies. This plan was never brought to fruition, but a plaster model of the elephant existed here for years until it became a disintegrating eyesore and a bane to the citizens of Paris. You may recall that there were also plans for an elephant where the Arc de Triomphe now stands, so it is striking that, for all the enthusiasm Paris showed for monumental elephants, not a single one now rests in the City of Light.</p>
<p>Our first stop in P&egrave;re Lachaise was at the Columbarium/Crematorium <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap02.png' class='InlineGraphic' />. A columbarium, in case you share my ignorance of this word, is a site where crematory ashes are stored &#8211; and the one at P&egrave;re Lachaise is a complex underground necropolis with courtyards and passages and multiple levels to house its thousands and thousands of niches for various individuals&rsquo; final remains. Some of the markers in these niches are extraordinarily elaborate, while others are unadorned (and unmarked) concrete slabs. We were looking specifically for Maria Callas&rsquo;s niche, and found it at #16259 in the Columbarium, but her ashes are not behind her marker: They were here at one time, following her death in 1977 &#8211; but when the ashes were stolen and then later recovered, they were not returned to P&egrave;re Lachaise, but rather were scattered on the Aegean Sea in conformance with her wishes.</p>
<p>Next we came to the gravesite of Oscar Wilde <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap03.png' class='InlineGraphic' />, which is also the unmarked repository of the man who commissioned it: Robert Ross. Wilde&rsquo;s grave is one of the most striking in the cemetery, with its modernist angel designed by sculptor Jacob Epstein. And it has one of the most striking stories: Though the reputation of the French is that they have fully moved beyond the prudery that plagues our side of the Atlantic (which is, in part, what brought Wilde to France in the first place), Paris was scandalized by the prominent genitalia on the angel adorning Wilde&rsquo;s tomb. The entire structure was at one point covered in tarpaulin by the French police to protect the public from its indecency. And the penis and testicles were later chipped off, serving, it is said, as a paperweight on the desks of a succession of caretakers at P&egrave;re Lachaise. (At some point, the member was lost, and has never been recovered.) The tomb is bathed in kisses from people who have traveled the world to pay respects to this patron saint of iconoclasm, much proving the epitaph &#8211; a verse from Wilde&rsquo;s <i>Ballad of Reading Gaol</i> &#8211; that is engraved, but nearly unreadable, under the layers of lipstick:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center"><tr><td>
<i>And alien tears will fill for him<br />
Pity&rsquo;s long-broken urn,<br />
For his mourners will be outcast men,<br />
And outcasts always mourn.</i>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Next up was the much more subtle grave of another patron of iconoclasm, Gertrude Stein <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap04.png' class='InlineGraphic' />, whose long-time and reasonably public relationship with Alice B. Toklas should have endeared her to left, except that she embraced the most intractable and indefensible views of the right: Stein was a life-long Republican and vocally opposed Roosevelt and the New Deal; she endorsed the fascist regime of Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War; and she embraced leaders of the Nazi-collaborationist Vichy government in France (even to the point of helping one, Bernard Fa&yuml;, escape from prison after he was sent there for life in punishment for his war crimes as a functionary of that government). Perhaps it will surprise you to learn that Adolph Hitler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938. And perhaps it will surprise you even more to learn that Gertrude Stein, a proud and self-confident Jew, authored the nomination. Her words included the following passage, &#8220;By suppressing Jews ... he was ending struggle in Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>With an ironic proximity to Hitler&rsquo;s defender, it was among the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Monument aux R&eacute;sistants D&eacute;port&eacute;s");LangBoxJ("EN", "Memorial to Deported Resisters");</script> <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap05.png' class='InlineGraphic' /> in P&egrave;re Lachaise that we got our first exposure to a symbol embraced by the French in their World War II memorials: the red-triangle badge that identified French political prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. I was already long familiar with the intricate symbols that the Nazi regime used to categorize its concentration camp prisoners because of the adoption of the pink triangle as a marker of solidarity in the lesbian and gay community &#8211; but I had not been aware of what a galvanizing force the coordinate symbol for French political prisoners had been for this nation&rsquo;s wartime survivors.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="20090905/NaziBadges.jpg" /></p>
<p>The chart above shows most of the triangles, though oddly excluding the brown that was used to identify Gypsies, and including two indistinguishable versions of black for unemployed Germans and unemployed persons of other nationalities; and, though this chart doesn&rsquo;t show it, black was used more broadly and more generally for &#8220;Antisocials.&#8221; (Which leads one to the snide suspicion that the Third Reich&rsquo;s enthusiasm for order may have surpassed their skill at implementing it.)</p>
<p>Anyway, in case you&rsquo;re not fluent in the Nazisprache, the columns are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Red:</b>  Political Enemies</li>
	<li><b>Green:</b> Habitual Criminals</li>
	<li><b>Blue:</b> Emigrants</li>
	<li><b>Purple:</b> &#8220;Bible Researchers&#8221; (a euphemism for Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses)</li>
	<li><b>Pink:</b> Homosexuals</li>
	<li><b>Black:</b> Unemployed Germans</li>
	<li><b>Black:</b> Unemployed Persons of Other Nationalities</li>
</ul>
<p>And moving downward, the rows indicate:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic colors</li>
	<li>Repeat offenders (bar above)</li>
	<li>Penal battalion inmates (dot below)</li>
	<li>Jews (superimposed upward-pointing yellow triangle; a yellow star was used for the overwhelming majority of Jews who didn&rsquo;t fit into one of these categories)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below that, it gets a bit convoluted, and I would send you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camp_badges">Wikipedia</a> for a more authoritative explanation &#8211; but toward the bottom you will see red triangles with superimposed letters, representing political prisoners of specific nationalities. French political prisoners were thus identified with a capital <i>F</i> &#8211; the symbol that recurred in various memorials:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="20090905/NaziRedTriangleFrench.png" /></p>
<p>By far the most striking of the memorials displaying this symbol was the Natzweiler-Struthof Memorial, in recognition of the persons who suffered in that notorious concentration camp.  The monument shows a desperately emaciated, skeletal figure collapsed or dead on triangle of stacked stone (almost certainly symbolic of the extreme labor that the prisoners were forced to endure), tapering to the red triangle with the letter <i>F</i>. The fact that you (like I) may not have heard of this camp is part of the tragedy of the story: The &#8220;NN&#8221; at the top of the monument stands for <script>LangBoxJ("DE", "&bdquo;Nacht und Nebel&ldquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;Night and Fog&#8221;");</script>, a particularly odious branch of the Nazi war machine in which political opponents in occupied lands were seized in the middle of the night and taken to remote and secret camps, such as this one, to be worked to death under brutally hard conditions &#8211; their families never being told of their location or circumstance. Prisoners in the &#8220;Nacht und Nebel&#8221; camps would be transferred frequently between these facilities, in crowded trucks on a multi-day commute with no food or water. When in a camp, their typical day would have them awakened at 5:00 AM, forced to stand at attention (often in in freezing and wet conditions) for hours, then put to backbreaking labor for over twelve solid hours with only a twenty-minute break for an insubstantial meal. This is what one risked being a member of the French Resistance in the 1940s, and this is why that red triangle is such an honor among the French people.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the World War II memorials is the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Mur des F&eacute;der&eacute;s");LangBoxJ("EN", "Communards&rsquo; Wall");</script> <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap06.png' class='InlineGraphic' />, in honor of the people that Karl Marx once recognized as the only example ever realized of a <script>LangBoxJ("DE", "&bdquo;Diktatur des Proletariats&ldquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221;");</script>. This eastern wall of the cemetery, however, is not commemorated because it is the place where they rest in peace; rather, it is commemorated because it is the place where they died in horror: On May 28, 1871, the last 147 defenders of the Paris Commune were taking refuge among these graves when the military swept in, shot them dead, and tossed them into an open ditch in front of the wall that now is named in their honor. This ended the noble experiment of the Paris Commune, and ushered in the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;Semaine sanglante&nbsp;&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;Bloody Week&#8221;");</script> in which about 20,000 French citizens were killed, and over 5,000 were deported, merely for having been in support of the Paris Commune. Jules Jouy wrote of the wall as follows:</p>

<p>Our next stop was at the grave of &Eacute;dith Piaf (&nbsp;<script>LangBoxJ("IPA", "/edit pjaf/");</script>&nbsp;) <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap07.png' class='InlineGraphic' />, buried here beside her daughter, Marcelle. Almost the whole of Piaf&rsquo;s life was a series of bitter challenges, among which were that she saw Marcelle die of meningitis at the age of two; lost the love of her life, Marcel Cerdan, in a plane crash; endured herself three near-fatal automobile crashes; and divorced her husband, Jaques Pills (whom she had married long after Cerdan&rsquo;s death). She finally found happiness with a man by the name of Th&eacute;o Sarapo &#8211; but was denounced even so because he was many years her junior.  The physical and psychological pain led to morphine and alcohol addictions, and Piaf succumbed to liver cancer at the age of 47 in 1963.  Adding insult to injury, the Roman Catholic Church denied her a funeral mass citing her lifestyle as the reason &#8211; but the citizens of Paris were unmoved by the church&rsquo;s intolerance, and her funeral procession drew a crowd of 100,000 to the cemetery. Some say that it was the only time since the end of World War II that Paris traffic came to a standstill.</p>
<p>Farther up, we came to the tombs of La Fontaine (Jean de La Fontaine) and Moli&egrave;re (the stage name of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin) <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap08.png' class='InlineGraphic' />. The setup leaves one with the impression that they were lovers, but this does not seem to have been the case &#8211; though perhaps they were just as oppressed as if they had been: La Fontaine and Moli&egrave;re were actors in the 17th Century, a time period in which the profession was viewed with distrust and disdain. Indeed, French law at the time of his death held that, as an actor, Moli&egrave;re could not be buried in sacred ground &#8211; but his widow received a special dispensation from the king that he could have a &#8220;normal&#8221; cemetery funeral if (1) he were buried at night and (2) the interment were done in the part of the cemetery reserved for unbaptized babies.  It was not here, however, that this occurred:  Rather, at a time of greater respect for their contributions (and frankly, in an effort to establish the cachet of P&egrave;re Lachaise in the minds of the people), La Fontaine and Moli&egrave;re were disinterred from their original plots and brought here to P&egrave;re Lachaise when this cemetery opened in 1817.  Having been contemporaries and associates in life, they were entombed side-by-side to maintain their association in death.</p>
<p>The plate marking the grave of Jim Morrison <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap09.png' class='InlineGraphic' /> is the third marker to be placed above his simple pine casket (selected at the time because it was the cheapest coffin available at P&egrave;re Lachaise):  The first was a simple marker placed by French officials when the family had taken no action in this regard. That marker was stolen in 1973, and the second came a few years later, when sculptor Mladen Mikulin placed a marker and bust above the grave, an adornment that was said to be <span class="dropnote">vandalized incessantly</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.  The bust was stolen in 1988 and replaced in the 1990s with the third marker, designed by his family &#8211; illustrating, perhaps, a rapprochement with the son that they lost, more or less literally, to a career they never accepted.  In life, Morrison&rsquo;s father commented to him that he should &#8220;give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I considered to be a complete lack of talent in this direction.&#8221; Yet now, on his tombstone, under his name and the dates of his life, is the inscription in Greek: <script>LangBoxJ("EL", "Κατα Τον Δαιμονα Εαυτου");LangBoxJ("EN", "True to His Spirit");</script>. Mikulin has prepared bronze busts to replace the one stolen in 1988, and is currently seeking permission to have them installed. One poignant dichotomy is Morrison&rsquo;s popularity:  One the day that he was laid to rest, only five people showed up to mourn &#8211; but almost immediately afterward, and continuing to this day, his gravesite has attracted, by several orders of magnitude, more attention than any other at P&egrave;re Lachaise. His fans leave tokens of remembrance for his (and often their own) hedonistic lifestyle, empty liquor bottles, cigarette butts, and used condoms being popular offerings.  The problem is so severe that cemetery authorities have a 24-hour security guard posted discretely nearby to prevent vandalism, theft, and desecration (though we looked for such a person, out of curiosity, on our visit and didn&rsquo;t see anyone).</p>

<p>The work of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap10.png' class='InlineGraphic' /> (marked tersely on his headstone as &#8220;<span class="SmallCaps">a fred chopin</span>&#8221;) was described by his contemporary, Robert Schumann, as &#8220;cannon buried in flowers.&#8221; It&rsquo;s not for this reason, but if we stipulate that Chopin is the cannon, the same is true for his grave: Chopin&rsquo;s music has so deeply moved so many people, through so many years, that his gravesite is inevitably buried under a cascade of flowers &#8211; a spontaneous tribute by his fans and admirers that endures without any official organization, so reliably so, in fact, that guidebooks confidently instruct that one can locate the site by looking for the mountain of flowers even in the dead of winter.</p>
<p>Every culture has a story of star-crossed tragic lovers, and France&rsquo;s is the story of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se and Ab&eacute;lard. This one is uncommon among such tales in that the protagonists were real people &#8211; but it&rsquo;s covered in so many layers of &#8220;What the fuck?&#8221; that I don&rsquo;t even want to tell it.  (Nor do I think that I, or anyone else, successfully could; certainly Wikipedia is a failure in this regard.)  Anyway, let&rsquo;s get this over with ...</p>
<p>&#8220;Ab&eacute;lard&#8221; was Pierre Ab&eacute;lard, described as &#8220;the keenest thinker and boldest theologian of the 12th Century.&#8221; &#8220;H&eacute;lo&iuml;se&#8221; was H&eacute;lo&iuml;se d’Argenteuil, a gifted student of classical letters.  Ab&eacute;lard found her such a promising student (and such a promising beauty) that he persuaded her uncle, Fulbert, to allow him to move into their home and educate her.  Predictably, Ab&eacute;lard fell in love with H&eacute;lo&iuml;se (etc., etc.) &#8211; but Fulbert was apparently surprised that the tutor&rsquo;s services to his niece extended beyond classical letters, and summarily evicted Ab&eacute;lard.  H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, however, was pregnant, and gave birth to their son, whom she named <span class="dropnote">&#8220;Astrolabe.&#8221;</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. At various points, each of the three of them (Ab&eacute;lard, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, and Fulbert) thought that a secret marriage between Ab&eacute;lard and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se would be a grand idea, despite the presumption that it would ruin Ab&eacute;lard&rsquo;s career &#8211; but, alas, never all three at the same time.  Eventually, the secret marriage took place, but, for unknown reasons, Fulbert was left with the impression that Ab&eacute;lard had abandoned H&eacute;lo&iuml;se rather than marry her, so he had Ab&eacute;lard attacked in the middle of the night and castrated.  This <i>did</i> ruin Ab&eacute;lard&rsquo;s career, so he and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se joined, respectively, a monastery and a convent, still maintaining sporadic communication.  They were originally buried together at the Oratory of the Paraclete, but may have been moved to the tomb <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap11.png' class='InlineGraphic' /> at P&egrave;re Lachaise when the cemetery opened, as were many other distinguished gravesites that were intended to draw attention to the new burial ground.  The Oratory of the Paraclete, however, insists that this never happened, and that the structure in P&egrave;re Lachaise is merely a cenotaph.</p>

<p>Still, questions abound:
<ul>
	<li>Did women of the day really have the social standing that H&eacute;lo&iuml;se is presented as having in this story?  I&rsquo;d love to believe that lives would be ruined over a person&rsquo;s enthusiasm for educating a promising woman in the 12th Century, but I&rsquo;m just not convinced that France of that day was so progressive.</li>
	<li>Why, exactly, would the marriage ruin Ab&eacute;lard&rsquo;s career?</li>
	<li>And was such a risk (if it even existed) really greater than leaving his lover unmarried to raise their bastard son?</li>
	<li>Why did Ab&eacute;lard&rsquo;s castration ruin his career? (One is tempted to the snarky observation that, if this were really an issue for a professor of the day, Fulbert shouldn&rsquo;t have been so surprised.)</li>
	<li>Why were they buried together after having been kept more-or-less apart for all of their lives?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the tomb is beautiful (probably more so when it&rsquo;s not covered in scaffolding).  The story; not so much.</p>
<p>Moving further through our tour, we were brought to the grave of Colette <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap12.png' class='InlineGraphic' />, the mononym by which Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette chose to be known.  Colette is best known as author of the <i>Gigi</i> series (upon which the movie of that name was based) &#8211; but this pr&eacute;cis hardly does justice to her life and her work:  Colette was married thrice &#8211; first to Henri Gauthier-Villars, a famous bisexual (which I suspect was unusual in 1893) under whose name her <i>Claudine</i> series was published; second to Henri de Jouvenel, whom she divorced after having an affair with his son; and third to Maurice Goudeket.  Like her first husband, Colette was famously bisexual and had many affairs with women and men between (and occasionally during) her marriages, including one with a woman by the name of Mathilde de Morny that extended onto the stage of the Moulin Rouge:  Their onstage kiss during a production of <i>R&ecirc;ve d&rsquo;&Eacute;gypte</i> <span class="dropnote">nearly led to a riot</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>, save for the action of the police.  The outcome was that this work was banned and Colette and de Morny were prevented from living together, though their relationship continued through five years.  I am aware, alas, that not everyone will share my enthusiasm for Colette&rsquo;s escapades in the bedroom (and I think we can all agree that her affair with her stepson, leading to her second divorce, was a tad on the sketchy side), but in other arenas she was unquestionably a saint: During World War I, she converted her husband&rsquo;s estate into a hospital for the wounded, an act of charity for which she was admitted to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Ordre national de la L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;honneur");LangBoxJ("EN", "National Order of the Legion of Honour");</script>.  And during World War II, she protected the Jews in her life from the Nazi advance, including hiding her Jewish husband in their attic for the duration of the war.  On balance, the Roman Catholic Church found her wanting, and denied her last rites.  But the French Republic deemed her a hero, and gave her a state funeral.</p>

					<td>And I&rsquo;m really starting to see a trend here, as this won&rsquo;t be the last point in my narrative in which Paris was not quite as progressive as might have been thought.  It&rsquo;s certainly a forward-thinking city now, and probably has been throughout modern history &#8211; but a substantial number of its most prominent residents have come there from places less liberated, and have found Paris to be not quite ready for them either (as quite a few of these cemetery stories bear witness).</td>

<p>Near the exit, we came to a line of mausolea along P&egrave;re Lachaise&rsquo;s <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Avenue Principale");LangBoxJ("EN", "Main Avenue");</script>, two of which were recommended, the first of which was that of Gioachino Rossini <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap13.png' class='InlineGraphic' />. Rossini is by far best known for his <script>LangBoxJ("IT", "<i>Il barbiere di Siviglia</i>");LangBoxJ("EN", " <i>The Barber of Seville</i>");</script>, which bombed when it opened, even attracting jeering from a jealous competitor &#8211; but which is now a classic piece (perhaps <i>the</i> classic piece) of its genre.  When Rossini met Beethoven (who was already deaf at the time of their meeting), Beethoven wrote to Rossini, &#8220;Ah, Rossini. So you’re the composer of The Barber of Seville. I congratulate you. It will be played as long as Italian opera exists.&#8221; Other than music, Rossini&rsquo;s great love was food, and several prominent dishes that were created and named for him survive to this day. One example is Tournedos Rossini, which in the Wikipedia description sounds like a most delicious way to advance oneself to a gouty premature death: &#8220;The dish comprises a tournedos of beef, pan-fried in butter, served on a crouton, and topped with a slice of whole foie gras. The dish is garnished with slices of black truffle, and finished with a Madeira demi-glace sauce.&#8221; Alas, all that is in P&egrave;re Lachaise is a memory: The mausoleum is empty, with Rossini&rsquo;s remains having been moved to the 
<script>LangBoxJ("IT", "Basilica di Santa Croce");LangBoxJ("EN", "Basilica of the Holy Cross");</script> in Florence.</p>
<p>The second mausoleum was that of Georges-Eug&egrave;ne Haussmann <img src='20090905/PereLachaiseMap14.png' class='InlineGraphic' />. Haussmann may have been prone to a bit of puffery &#8211; he styled himself &#8220;Baron Haussmann,&#8221; though the French government, which recognizes such titles, didn&rsquo;t recognize this one &#8211; but he, more than any other person, is responsible for distinguishing the Parisian sense of place that thrives to this day:  First, he built many of the prominent avenues that so enliven the city, a feat he accomplished by flattening neighborhoods, when necessary, to implement his plan.  Here you can see a map of the &Icirc;le de a Cit&eacute; as its streets were configured before Haussmann, and by hovering over the image you will see the changes that Haussmann&rsquo;s plan brought to this small island:</p>

<p>Haussmann&rsquo;s designs were not without criticism:  The long, straight boulevards served the purpose of Napol&eacute;on III&rsquo;s militarism and authoritarianism.  The buildings reinforced social class structures that the French had been so ready to challenge in the Revolution just a few decades prior.  And the uniformity of the building appearances was an outgrowth of the preference for conformity and reproducibility that came from the Industrial Revolution, and that has been at odds with craft and art. Nonetheless, Haussmann seems to have made some good choices when putting pen to paper, for even though his politics may not be fondly remembered, his streets attract romantics from across the globe.</p>

<p>The terms, if you share my lack of experience with Roman Catholic structure and symbolism, are these:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Basilica:</b> A basilica has no special function as such; rather, a church is simply named by the pope as a basilica in honor of its history, symbolism, or association with that pope.  Such designation ranks the basilica higher than other churches in the diocese (except, of course, for the cathedral).  And it confers certain rights, such as carrying of the umbraculum and tintinnabulum (an umbrella-like thing and a bell) in processions, and use of particular vestements by church officials. Sacr&eacute;-C&oelig;ur is a &#8220;minor basilica,&#8221; which is the best that it could ever hope for: &#8220;major basilicas,&#8221; by definition, exist only in Rome.</li>
	<li><b>Sacred Heart:</b> This is a liturgy particular to catholic (lower-case <i>C</i>) churches (i.e., Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopalian/Anglican), referring specifically to the physical &#8211; and often described as &#8220;wounded&#8221; &#8211; heart of Jesus Christ. Symbolically, it reminds the observer of the loving nature of Jesus.</li>
</ol>
<p>This particular basicila was conceived and built in the context of continued social divisions among the French about 100 years after the Revolution, and about three years after the crushing of the Paris Commune. The National Assembly specified that Sacr&eacute;-C&oelig;ur would be built to atone for the sins of the Communards (which, of course, not everyone thought was necessary). And various detractors were passionate in their opposition to the building, calling it an &#8220;an incessant provocation to civil war&#8221; and filing legal challenges even as late as 1897, at which point the church had been open for services for six years. </p>

<p>To end the day, Mom and I went to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "M&eacute;morial des Martyrs de la D&eacute;portation");LangBoxJ("EN", "Memorial to the Martyrs of the Deportation");</script>, more commonly known by its shortened name, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "M&eacute;morial de la D&eacute;portation");LangBoxJ("EN", "Memorial of the Deportation");</script>. This tribute to French citizens who were handed over to the Nazi police state by the Vichy collaborationists is one of the most striking of the Holocaust memorials that I have visited, as every piece of the architecture reminds one of the suffocating grasp of the Third Reich: One enters through steep, narrow stairs into a stark concrete bunker from which there appears no escape.  The free-flowing waters of the Seine are visible through a narrow gap, but unreachable as they lay beyond bars and bayonet spears &#8211; a vivid reminder of what it must have felt like to look out the slats of a cattle car at the countryside rolling by. An underground crypt is built into the earth, housing 200,000 crystals that represent the individuals sacrificed by France&rsquo;s puppet wartime government, as well as the mortal remains of one of those victims. Unfortunately, pictures were forbidden inside the memorial, but can be found on Google if you are interested.</p>
<p>In another surprising example of French prudery, the woman in line ahead of me was initially denied entrance because the guard thought her button-down shirt was too revealing, having been fastened at the second or third button, just below her clavicle. But she was allowed in when she tightened her neckline. (I can assure you that the way she was dressed would have been perfectly acceptable in the U.S. at a religious service or any sort of public presentation.)</p>
