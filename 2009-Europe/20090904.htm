<p>We bought our tickets and started at the top floor of the museum, generally regarded as the best part of a spectacular collection. Mom (along with the vast majority of its visitors) was most excited by the impressionists &#8211; but my favorite moment came in seeing the painting that you, I, and most of the world know as <i>Whistler&rsquo;s Mother</i>. The actual title, however, is a bit of a moving target: Officially it is <i>Arrangement in Grey and Black: The Artist&rsquo;s Mother</i>. The original title was simply, <i>Arrangement in Grey and Black</i> &#8211; but righteous indignation was one of the chief exports of the Victorian era, and Victorian audiences were offended that a painting which was obviously a portrait was titled as an &#8220;arrangement.&#8221; Yes, you read that right: These pompous douchebags were actually <i>offended</i> at the painting&rsquo;s <i>title</i> &#8211; so much so that the work was nearly rejected by the 1872 Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Art in London. Whistler never again sought their approval, but he did bow to the mob in this case by appending &#8220;Portrait of the Artist&rsquo;s Mother&#8221; as a subtitle (at some point later it being shortened, apparently, simply to &#8220;The Artist&rsquo;s Mother&#8221;). Also, because a successor piece was painted the following year (<i>Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 2: Portrait of Thomas Carlyle</i>), <i>Whistler&rsquo;s Mother</i> is sometimes identified as <i>Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1</i> (either with or without its subtitle).</p>
<p>In museums, I often find myself as fascinated with the frame as with the painting (not a harbinger of mental health, alas, as you&rsquo;ll see in a couple of paragraphs). I can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether the artist would approve; whether some curator agonized between choices, or just picked something based on price or expediency; whether an ancient and poorly chosen frame is kept because of the fragility of the art or the integrity of the memory. In <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, the title character was able to pick out the Holy Grail because he comprehended that Christ&rsquo;s chalice would be the humble one among a tableau of garish pretenders. The frames of great artworks sometimes echo this sentiment, and sometimes do not. But rarely, rarely is any information on the frame available. Yet in <i>this</i> case there is a record: James McNeill Whistler, himself, designed the frame around the canvas on which a thousand people each hour look at his mother.</p>
<p>From the top floor to the bottom (but mostly on the top) we made our way past the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay&rsquo;s embarrassment of riches in its permanent collection, including works by Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, C&eacute;zanne, Seurat, Gauguin and Van&nbsp;Gogh. It is this breadth and depth that illustrates the importance of Paris&rsquo;s museum scene in general: Even with a collection as stunning as this, the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay is only the <i>third</i> most popular museum in the French capital (after the Louvre and the Pompidou Centre), but with over three million visitors a year, it is the <i>eighth</i> most visited museum in the world.</p>
<p>A couple of my favorite works on the way downstairs included a cut-away model by Charles Garnier of his <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Palais Garnier");LangBoxJ("EN", "Garnier Palace");</script>, home to what is currently known as <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra national de Paris");LangBoxJ("EN", "the National Opera of Paris");</script> (the name has changed twenty-seven times since it was founded, most recently in 1994), and nearby a plan-relief in a different scale of its neighborhood, set under plexiglass tiles in the floor so that you could walk above it.</p>
<p>Alas, that&rsquo;s about it for my observations. If you want a compendium of the works of the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay, I&rsquo;m just not the writer you&rsquo;re looking for: I don&rsquo;t remember and I didn&rsquo;t take many photographs. There are probably websites you can go to for the data (I hear there&rsquo;s a lot of information on the Internet nowadays) &#8211; but I find I&rsquo;m just not the kind of guy who wallows in museums. I enjoy the architecture more than the sculptures; the frames more than the paintings; the getting there more than the being there. The truth is, I learned far more about <i>Whistler&rsquo;s Mother</i> here in Atlanta than I did when I was standing in front of it; all I got in Paris was (1) a sense of its size and (2) a psychic bond with the painting that came from being in its presence. But true knowledge about it? That came before and after &#8211; but not during.</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I do enjoy visiting museums. The problem is just that I don&rsquo;t learn much in them because I find them so overwhelming. In truth I dreaded writing this section because I pride myself on being able to eke out details in my travel experiences that go unnoticed by others &#8211; but in museums the tables are turned: My mind glazes over and a I become consumed by the minutiae &#8211; the room layout and flow patterns, the natural and artificial light, the precise neutral color selected for the walls, the reactions and demographics of the other patrons, and of course the friggin&rsquo; frames; just about anything but the art. And an OCD side of my brain kicks in, telling me that I must enter every single room, or none at all; contemplate every piece, or none at all; read every placard, or none at all. On the outside I look like everyone else; on the inside my brain is ... doing what? (With my eyes, it would be called &#8220;REM&#8221;; with my lungs, &#8220;hyperventilating.&#8221;) In short, I try to take in the experience in the broadest possible strokes, as I can&rsquo;t see the trees for the forest. The Louvre was actually easier, because you go into it knowing that is is impossible to fully appreciate the collection, so failure is forgiven there at the ticket booth &#8211; but a full appreciation is not impossible at the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay (not for other people, at least), so my failure to accomplish it resonates throughout my visit. You would think that it would be easier to get a sense of the collection when the walls are closing in on you, but unfortunately that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. Finally leaving the museum feels like paying off a debt.</p>

WriteParisSignJ(4, "Île ((de la)) Cité");
</script>
<p>At the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay, we hopped on the execrable RER Line C and made our way one station over to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute;");LangBoxJ("EN", "City Island");</script>
, served by the <b>St-Michel &#8211; Notre-Dame</b> Station. This island was home base of the Parisii, the Gallic tribe from which Paris took its name. Their city (village, really) carried a different name &#8211; &#8220;Lucretia&#8221; &#8211; and, aside from location, wasn&rsquo;t really a predecessor to Paris at all, as there was a thorough change-over of people and structures between the ancient and the newer settlements.</p>
<p>As Paris&rsquo;s &#8220;ground zero,&#8221; you would expect the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; to be in the 1st Arrondissement. You would not be wrong, as the western third of the island is, indeed, therein &#8211; but the parts of greatest import are, oddly, in the 4th Arrondissement. Lest you think I use the term &#8220;greatest import&#8221; with a self-absorbed viewpoint because <i>I</i> spent all <i>my</i> time on the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; in the 4th Arrondissement, I declaim the following: All road distances in France are measured from the zero-kilometer post, which rests in the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place du Parvis de Notre-Dame");LangBoxJ("EN", "Notre Dame Courtyard");</script>, which, in turn, rests in the 4th Arrondissement.</p>
<p>The &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; is currently one of two natural islands in Paris, dividing the Seine into the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Grand bras");LangBoxJ("EN", "Great Arm");</script> along the Right Bank, and the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Petit bras");LangBoxJ("EN", "Small Arm");</script> along the Left Bank. I say &#8220;currently&#8221; because prior to the construction of the Pont Neuf, the western end of the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; was ringed by three other islands, now united as one with their much larger cousin: the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Icirc;le aux Juifs");LangBoxJ("EN", "Island of the Jews");</script> (unfortunately, not so named because this was where Jews were made to live, but rather because it was where they were made to die), the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Icirc;le du Patriarche");LangBoxJ("EN", "Island of the Patriarch");</script>, and the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Icirc;lot de la Gourdaine");LangBoxJ("EN", "Islet of La Gourdaine");</script> (named for a mint by that name located thereon). There is also mention in some contexts of a fourth island, the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Icirc;le aux B&oelig;ufs");LangBoxJ("EN", "Island of Cows");</script> &#8211; but I am uncertain whether this is an alternate name for one of the aforementioned small islands, a former name for the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute;, or yet another island altogether. These were basically sandbars anyway, so one can imagine that there was some shifting over time. In any event, they ceased to be separate entities with the construction of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pont Neuf ");LangBoxJ("EN", "New Bridge");</script>, which must have seemed like a fantastic name when the bridge was brand-spanking, but which seems like a silly moniker for what is now the oldest bridge in Paris. In fairness to its namers, though, it was described as &#8220;New&#8221; not just for its recency, but also for its style: The &#8220;old&#8221; style of Parisian bridges (like bridges in many European cities) had shops that lined the edges of the crossing, blocking the view, and allowing easy pollution, of the river. This &#8220;New (style) Bridge&#8221; was built without shops and thus afforded unimpeded views of the Seine.</p>
<p>The name of the administrative region containing Paris is <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "l&rsquo;&Icirc;le-de-France");LangBoxJ("EN", "The Island of France");</script>, which naturally leads to the speculation that the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;&Icirc;le&nbsp;&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;Island&#8221;");</script> in &Icirc;le-de-France and &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; are somehow related, as the latter is the epicenter of the former. This, however, is not the case: The historical name &laquo;&nbsp;l&rsquo;&Icirc;le-de-France&nbsp;&raquo; (resurrected to be applied to this region in 1976) came because these words in French sound like the the Frankish name for this area: <script>LangBoxJ("FRK", "Liddle Franke");LangBoxJ("EN", "Little France");</script>.</p>
<p>Our primary stop on the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; was the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cath&eacute;drale Notre-Dame de Paris");LangBoxJ("EN", "Our Lady of Paris Cathedral");</script>, which we did not climb, owing to the very long line of people waiting to do so, but otherwise explored thoroughly from the outside and inside. I am chagrined to report, however, that Notre Dame&rsquo;s function as a tourist icon was not subordinated to its role as a place of worship, and it is thus that we throngs of visitors shared the space with a group of people whose simple intent was to use the building as if it were a church &#8211; a group whom we grossly outnumbered and grotesquely interrupted with our shuffling and whispering and flash photography. Had there been animosity between the tourists and the parishioners, the latter would have been decimated; as it was, their prayers were simply drowned out. To be honest, it is one of my least proud moments as a traveler: I&rsquo;m aware in retrospect of many times that I&rsquo;ve been a source of annoyance and interruption when visiting cultures that I don&rsquo;t fully understand, and I&rsquo;m certain that there is at least an equivalent number of other times that haven&rsquo;t been brought to my attention &#8211; but I&rsquo;m not at all pleased at having been part of such an intrusion into a culture that is very similar to my own and, indeed, is one that I comprehend pretty well. In review, I think I should have turned around and made plans to return to Notre Dame at a time between services; and worse, I think I knew this at the time and just didn&rsquo;t do it. Worse still, I believe that I justified my intrusion (to the extent that I thought about it at all) with the knowledge that I was but one boor among, literally, thousands. This is a logical fallacy that I consider both contemptible and beneath me. I can&rsquo;t turn back the clock, but I pledge to take this as a learning experience and to make better decisions in the future.</p>
<p>As for its history, Notre Dame was constructed over 182 years, beginning in 1163 at the direction of the bishop Maurice de Sully. He insisted that Paris&rsquo;s cathedral at that time, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cath&eacute;drale Saint-&Eacute;tienne");LangBoxJ("EN", "St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral");</script>, was &#8220;unworthy&#8221; in unspecified ways, and had it razed to make way for Notre Dame. Archaeological evidence suggests, however, that this may have been a vanity project for the bishop, as St. Stephen&rsquo;s appears to have been a massive edifice, with a five-aisled nave and a <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "36 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "118'", false);</script> fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
<p>Still, Notre Dame is indisputably grander in every way &#8211; a fact evidenced in particular with regard to its flying buttresses, which manifest a building out of scale with what its composite materials can withstand: Today we think of these as beautiful components of the building &#8211; a form of architectural ornamentation that gives the cathedral both grandeur and charm. But they were not part of the plan, and were added only to prevent collapse of the choir walls, which had been built high and thin in conformity with Gothic fashion, and which began to show stress fractures before the building was even completed. In the 21st century, they are gorgeous; in the 12th, they were the equivalent of that chunk of rebar you wedge under your deck to keep it from collapsing onto your driveway. I suppose we can only hope that our own fix-it schemes are judged with equal kindness by posterity.</p>
<p>As one would assume for a building so central (both literally and figuratively) to the lives of Parisians, Notre Dame has been a coveted pawn in the game of chess that various armies have played across the blood-soaked fields of northern France:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its first major threat came from the Huguenots in 1548, who attacked artworks in the cathedral that they considered idolatrous.</li>
<li>Other threats came from within the church, including desecration of a colossal statue of St. Christopher, dating from 1413 and destroyed in 1786.</li>
<li>In <script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "Ans I-III", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "1792-1794 CE", false);</script>, the building was rededicated to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Culte de la Raison");LangBoxJ("EN", "Cult of Reason");</script>, an atheistic creed that arose in the early days of the Revolution. Indeed, Notre Dame was ground zero for this new entity, as the site of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "F&ecirc;te de la Libert&eacute; ");LangBoxJ("EN", "Festival of Liberty");</script> on <script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "20 brumaire, an II", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "November 10, 1793", false);</script> &#8211; a carnival-like event, considered shocking and notorious at the time, in which churches were ransacked, royal images were defaced, and rituals were celebrated that put martyrs of the Revolution in place of their counterparts in Christian history.</li>
<li>In <script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "An III", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "1794 CE", false);</script>, the building was given to service of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Culte de l&rsquo;&Ecirc;tre supr&ecirc;me");LangBoxJ("EN", "Cult of the Supreme Being");</script>, a deist creed established as the state religion by Maximilien Robespierre, who was equally disturbed by the Roman Catholic church (which its enthusiastic embrace of the monarchy) and the the atheistic bent of the early days of the Revolution. Robespierre likely wouldn&rsquo;t have died of old age under any circumstances, but his establishment of the Cult of the Supreme Being as France&rsquo;s state religion was a spark for the Thermidorian Reaction (named for the month of 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;thermidor&nbsp;&raquo;");</script> in which it occurred) that swept him from a position of absolute power to one of lying prone at the bottom of a guillotine.</li>
<li>During the Paris Commune of the late 19th Century, at the first rise of anarchist/communist ideology (before a split between these philosophies), the cathedral was nearly burned.</li>
<li>In 1939, to protect them from German bombing runs, the windows of the cathedral were removed for safe-keeping.</li>
</ul>
<p>We tried to have lunch at l&rsquo;&Icirc;lot Vache, a restaurant on the adjacent <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Icirc;le Saint-Louis");LangBoxJ("EN", "Saint Louis Island");</script> that Mom and I remembered fondly &#8211; but found them closed just as a thunderstorm broke. So we darted across the street to Le Caveau de l&rsquo;&icirc;sle, which promised &#8211; and delivered &#8211; a delicious and very traditional French meal.</p>
<p>Paris&rsquo;s reputation &#8211; not at all unjustified, I might add &#8211; is that is notoriously unable to perceive the beauty of its more daring architectural icons until they have first been recognized by the world at large; witness the initial disapproval of such treasures as the Eiffel Tower, the Pompidou Centre, the Pyramid at the Louvre, and the Grande Arche, among many others. The M&eacute;tro system, however, is an exception to the city&rsquo;s congenital distrust of imagination in architecture: A competition was held in 1889 to design the system&rsquo;s street presence &#8211; but every last one of the finalists was rejected by the 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Compagnie du chemin de fer m&eacute;tropolitain de Paris");LangBoxJ("EN", "Paris Metropolitan Railway Company");</script> for hewing to a too-conservative line. Ignoring the competition entirely, they hand-picked Hector Guimard to design the station entrances, and received from him an iconic art nouveau design that has been described as resembling large iron plants, or the legs of enormous insects. Many of these station entrances have been replaced by more modern designs &#8211; but one of Guimard&rsquo;s entrances adorns the single access to the <b>Cit&eacute;</b> station on the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute;.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact about the architecture of the Paris M&eacute;tro involves the footprint of the system. In America, our suburbs have traditionally been thought of as zones of prosperity, with large houses, large yards, and large cars. But in Europe, the inner cities never lost their luster, and it is the suburbs where one goes for cheap, dense, and often substandard housing. The circumstance (I&rsquo;m hesitant to call it a &#8220;problem,&#8221; as I hope it will become the rule in America as well) is continent-wide &#8211; but particularly acute in Paris. This is true, perhaps, because the circumstance is not <i>new</i> in Paris: When the M&eacute;tro was approved, it was the service plan of civil engineer Fulgence Bienven&uuml;e that was selected, precisely because it contained itself to the city limits of Paris. The citizens of the day considered this a safety issue, so much so that they were not content merely with an understanding that the trains <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> serve the suburbs; they devised a plan to make it so that the trains <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> serve the suburbs: Trains in France (including the suburban RER of this century) run on the left. The M&eacute;tro was designed to run on the right, so that it could never share tracks with a railway that ran outside the city proper.</p>
<p>We re-entered the M&eacute;tro at the <b>Cit&eacute;</b> station and returned to Mom&rsquo;s apartment.</p>

<p>While Mom and Billy rested at the apartment, I was antsy as usual and went back out to explore. High on my agenda was the nearby <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Icirc;le des Cygnes");LangBoxJ("EN", "Isle of the Swans");</script>, an artificial island that is long (&nbsp;<script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "850 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "2,789'", false);</script>&nbsp;), narrow (at its widest just <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "11 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "36'", false);</script>&nbsp;), and perfectly straight from one of its extremes to the other. It was originally created to protect the Port of Grenelle, but now serves as a public park and site of two of Paris&rsquo;s best known sculptures.</p>
<p>The first of these sculptures that I saw was an equestrian statue given to the city of Paris in 1958 by the Danish Government. Now, it is said that you shouldn&rsquo;t look a gift horse in the mouth &#8211; but that touchstone of etiquette was thoroughly ignored with regard to this particular horse and its rider: The sculpture was originally conceived as a memorial to Joan of Arc, but the Paris City Council and the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Commission centrale des monuments");LangBoxJ("EN", "Central Commission on Memorials");</script> 
expressed disapproval that it was too &#8220;emphatic&#8221; and &#8220;warlike&#8221; to represent the woman who claimed she answered only to God, and who led the French army in battle against the English with such ferocity that her foes felt they could silence her only by burning her publicly at the stake not once, not twice, but <i>thrice</i>, so that even her bones were reduced to ash. Anyway, the Danes elected to avoid a diplomatic row by changing not the design of the sculpture, but the name &#8211; which appeased the City Council, and removed it from the purview of the Commission. It is thus that the statue I observed carried not the name of Joan of Arc, but rather the name, 
<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "<i>La France renaissante</i>");LangBoxJ("EN", "<i>Resurgent France</i>");</script>.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the &Icirc;le des Cygnes sits the largest of Paris&rsquo;s replicas of that famous statue in New York Harbor &#8211; you know it as the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "<i>Statue of Liberty</i>");LangBoxJ("FR", "<i>Statue de la Libert&eacute;</i>");</script>, but it&rsquo;s properly called <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "<i>Liberty Enlightening the World</i>");LangBoxJ("FR", "<i>La Libert&eacute; &eacute;clairant le monde</i>");</script> &#8211; that was a gift from the French to the American people in an era well before &#8220;Freedom Fries.&#8221; The version in New York rises <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "93 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "305'", false);</script>, including its pedestal and foundation; the replica on the &Icirc;le des Cygnes is <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "22 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "72'", false);</script> high, <span class="dropnote">including its base</span><span class="downarrow">¹➴</span>. The American statue has come to symbolize America&rsquo;s welcome of immigrants (another noble philosophy on which we&rsquo;ve turned our backs), but the original gift was to celebrate the eras of liberty in the two nations after their respective revolutions, just thirteen years apart.  The tablet on the American statue reads, &#8220;JULY IV MDCCLXXVI,&#8221; and that on the statue on the &Icirc;le des Cygnes reads, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;&nbsp;IV Juillet 1776 = XIV Juillet 1789&nbsp;&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;IV July 1776 = XIV July 1789&#8221;");</script>. They&rsquo;re fond of these replicas, by the way: There are two other copies of <i>Liberty Enlightening the World</i> in Paris: one in the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Jardin du Luxembourg");LangBoxJ("EN", "Luxembourg Garden");</script>, and the other in the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Mus&eacute;e des arts et m&eacute;tiers");LangBoxJ("EN", "Museum of Arts and Crafts");</script>, not to mention the copy of the torch near the Pont de l&rsquo;Alma. (Really, you almost get the feeling that they want the big one back.) The statue on the &Icirc;le des Cygnes originally faced the Eiffel Tower, but was reoriented in 1937 <span class="dropnote">to face its sister in New York</span><span class="downarrow">²➴</span>.</p>

<p>The current &Icirc;le des Cygnes is not, by the way, the first island in Paris to carry that name: Just upstream, you&rsquo;ll notice that the Seine is considerably narrower &#8211; but this is not how it has always been. The spot where the Mus&eacute;e du quai Branly now sits was once on the original &Icirc;le des Cygnes (itself a merger of several smaller islets, which I won&rsquo;t burden you by listing; though I will point out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Île_des_Cygnes_(former_island)">Wikipedia</a> holds this information, should you decide that you want it). The narrow channel between this previous &Icirc;le des Cygnes and the Left Bank was filled in toward the end of the 18th Century.</p>

<p>After the &Icirc;le des Cygnes, I continued on to see a couple of items that were of greater interest to me than to Mom and Billy:  The Centre Georges Pompidou and the adjacent Stravinsky Fountain.</p>
<p>As with most of their architectural icons, the Parisians hated the Centre Georges Pompidou when it opened in 1977 &#8211; but quickly warmed up to it. Art is, of course, in the eye of the beholder &#8211; but this is a case in which my view is that the original reaction of Paris was on target.</p>
<p>The distinction of the building &#8211; formally known as the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Centre national d&rsquo;art et de culture Georges-Pompidou");LangBoxJ("EN", "Georges Pompidou National Center for Art and Culture");</script> and named for the French president (&nbsp;<script>LangBoxJ("IPA", "/ʒɔʁʒ pɔ̃pidu/");</script>&nbsp;) under whom it was conceived &#8211; is that its <span class="dropnote">architectural elements are color-coded, and prominent on the building&rsquo;s exterior</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>: ducts that move water are green; those that move air are blue; electrical current, yellow; people, red.</p>
<table class="dropnoteframe">

					<td>My complaint is not that the architects (Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and Su Rogers, FYI) went too far with this design; rather, it is that they didn&rsquo;t go far enough: On approach the building fascinates &#8211; but on arrival, it is vivid, but perfectly static. One knows from reading of the structure that wind is blasting through the blue tubes; water is gushing through the green; electricity is coursing through the yellow &#8211; but this frenzy of activity is hidden from the street. The architectural design taunts us with the knowledge of what those colors and pipes represent, but hides from us the effect. I would have loved to have seen gauges and switches and such to allow us to comprehend the unusual nature of the Pompidou Centre&rsquo;s external systems. As it stands, it looks like a stunning pipe organ that has been rendered forever silent.</td>

<p>The <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Fontaine Stravinski");LangBoxJ("EN", "Stravinsky Fountain");</script>, also known as the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Fontaine des Automates");LangBoxJ("EN", "Fountain of the Robots");</script>, rests in <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place Stravinski");LangBoxJ("EN", "Stravinsky Plaza");</script>, along the south wall of the Centre Pompidou.</p>
<p>It opened to acclaim in 1983, despite a series of compromises in its design and construction: First, it is extraordinarily shallow by the standards of European ceremonial fountains (of which it was intended to be a modern complement). This is because it rests immediately above offices of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique (IRCAM)");LangBoxJ("EN", "Accoustical/Musical Institute for Research and Coordination");</script>, and needed to be as light as possible to avoid causing architectural damage to the rooms below. Second, the artistic participation was modified after its commission, when the selected artist, Jean Tinguely, insisted that sculptures by his wife, Niki de Saint Phalle, also be included &#8211; a controversial request because Saint Phalle&rsquo;s brightly colored human and animal forms appeared to share no artistic foundation with Tinguely&rsquo;s dark, monochrome, dadaist mechanical contrivances. Finally, Tinguely had a few requirements that were not universally welcomed: He did not want the sculptures affixed to the base, thus creating a need for snaking conduits on the base of the fountain. And he did not want the water treated, preferring that moss be allowed to grow on the fountain.</p>
<p>The individual works are intended to evoke the works of composer Igor Stravinsky, although not all of them (and especially Tinguely&rsquo;s) are immediately obvious to casual observers, even those who are familiar with Stravinsky&rsquo;s opus. They are:</p>

</ul>
<p>To me (if you&rsquo;re wondering) the fountain was a disappointment: As a work by Tinguely alone, or by Saint Phalle alone, it would have had an integrity that was lacking in the collaboration. And it had no anchor to the surrounding plaza, nor to the monumental Centre Pompidou that towers above it: It gives the appearance of being made from pre-fab parts, and could just as easily have been the centerpiece of a shopping mall. I went there excited to see the whimsy in this famous work, but found the magic to be far overshadowed by the mechanics. I&rsquo;d wanted to see it since the day it opened, so I have no regrets in the time I took to do so &#8211; but on a trip in which just about everything exceeded my expectations, the Stravinsky Fountain was an unfortunate outlier.</p>
