<p>There&rsquo;s not much to say about our flight home, except to swoon over the plane: We rode (with an Air France ticket) in one of Delta&rsquo;s newly refurbished 767s &#8211; and I can honestly say that I liked this flight in coach more than the 2007 trip to Greece in first class. The real improvement was the on-demand entertainment system, which was a vast step-up from the cruddy seven-movies-playing-simultaneously-on-seven-different-channels thing they had <span class="dropnote">in 2007</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. And the seats were surprisingly pleasant, too &#8211; reflecting, apparently, an effort to find a way that increases comfort, and gives room where the passenger needs it, while still allowing the compact seating configurations in coach that the airlines feel are vital to their profitability.</p>

<p>Anyway, the 767 was fantastic, and I actually regretted that I didn&rsquo;t have more time in it to catch up on the wonderful assortment of movies that I wanted to watch.  The two that I did find time for were <i>Star Trek XI</i> and <i>The Watchmen</i>.</p>

<p>As you may know, if you&rsquo;ve read my previous trip reports, one of the best moments of each vacation is coming home to the warm welcome of our dogs &ndash; Prince, Pepper, and Pip &ndash; on our back deck. This return gave us that same joy &ndash; but sadly, it gave us this joy for the last time.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful vacation, but I will never be able to think of it without remembering that this trip was bookended in death.  John Speaks&rsquo;s departure just before <i>our</i> departure was enough of a blow.  But a second brutal loss was that of our cherished dog, Pepper, whom we had worked so hard to love and protect for ten of her twelve years, after bringing her home as a twice-rejected adult dog from the Atlanta Humane Society. I hope, and believe, that we showed her such love that she thought the third time was the charm, and never yearned for the families who decided they could live without her. I cannot imagine giving up Pepper intentionally; it was devastating enough when I had no choice.</p>
<p>Pepper made strong impressions on everyone who met her: &quot;A cat in a dog&rsquo;s body&quot;; a &quot;little bear&quot;; and, invariably, &quot;the softest fur I&rsquo;ve ever felt.&quot; And she made a profound impression on us. When she fell gravely ill on our last trip, in 2007, we agonized over whether we&rsquo;d ever get to see her again. And having her run out the door to greet us when our taxi pulled up to the house at the end of that long flight home was one of the happiest moments of our lives.</p>
<p>Pepper came across as aloof, but Billy and I learned that she was always watching us from the corner of her eye. As the alpha dog, and the most territorial of our dogs, she kept us safe from predators real and imagined. </p>
<p>Pepper made it two more years after that joyous reunion. And I am thankful that illness didn&rsquo;t return to her <i>during</i> our trip this time. But just days after we got back, Pepper fell into an Addisonian crisis (a lack of steroids) that was brought on or exacerbated by the various ailments that were attacking her in the last week of her life: her treatment for Cushing&rsquo;s disease, a bacterial infection, a splenic disorder, and lymphoma.</p>

<p>Our flight from Dublin had returned  on September 10, a Thursday. By Sunday, Pepper was showing signs of illness. And when I got home from work on Monday, she could barely stand. With our regular vet closed, we rushed her to a 24-hour location, and left her overnight with little hope for her survival. Her fever sat at <script>MeasurementBoxJ("US", "105&deg;F", true);MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "41&deg;C", false);</script> 
for the whole next day &ndash; but her regular veterinarian (Dr. Fowler at Inman Park Animal Hospital) asked if we could bring her to him and give him a chance to save her life. His efforts were heroic (and I am not speaking in hyperbole): He got her fever down and restored her health to the point that she could stand, walk outside, and, by the weekend, spend time with us at home.</p>
<p>But Pepper was not recovering: Always having been a glutton, she refused every morsel that was offered, turning away from slices of ham, baby food, dog treats, peanut butter, and bread. Eventually, with nothing in her system, she went into seizures from low blood sugar, with a blood glucose reading that measured a staggeringly low 13 mg/dL (normal is over 100). Dr. Fowler met us at the clinic after hours, stabilized her blood sugar, and told us what we already knew: Pepper wasn&rsquo;t going to get any better, and the best we could do was to spare her more discomfort. Pepper, completely stoic through her ordeal up to this point, had finally begun to whimper.</p>
<p>We gave our consent and Dr. Fowler prepared the mixture that would end her life. First he injected a saline solution to clear her catheter. Then he gave her a sedative, and we saw her visibly relax. Then he filled a syringe with the pink liquid that would give her the chance, as Billy told her, to &quot;finally catch that squirrel.&quot; As Dr. Fowler squeezed the syringe, he <i>shouted</i> &ndash; so his kind words, the last words she would ever hear, would penetrate her sedative haze:</p>
<table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

    <td><b>!</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>And the syringe was empty. And Pepper was gone.</p>
<p>And Dr. Fowler&rsquo;s final praise is the happiest, and most painful, memory I have of her. </p>
<p>At the beginning of each trip, Billy and I load our cameras with pictures of the pets, to give us some comfort while we&rsquo;re away. To the right is the last picture of Pepper in good health. She&rsquo;s lying under the desk where I have been sitting to write this report, and coming to this page repeatedly, just to see her again as I tweak the wording or formatting or arrangement, has been both sweet and sad. </p>
<p>Pepper, I can only dream of bringing happiness to others as you brought it to us. You will never be forgotten, and will always be missed. I hope that in some way you&rsquo;re still out there; if so, I hope that you are happy, that you do not yearn for us, but that you remember us fondly. Goodbye, Pepperdog. I love(d) you. </p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t only people and pets in my life, though, that succumbed to their frailties in the time surrounding this vacation. Another victim of time was an ancient water oak in my back yard. Unlike John and Pepper, though, the tree brought joy not through light, but through shade. Yet, like them, it was cherished.</p>
<p>On the same day as Pepper&rsquo;s collapse (when we rushed her to the emergency room) I got the bad news about the tree &ndash; when Jon and Becca, my new neighbors, <span class="dropnote">shared the findings of an arborist they had brought in to look at it</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>: The tree was heavily weighted <i>toward</i> my house, hollow on the side <i>away from</i> my house (therefore lacking the internal structure to resist a tumble away from the hollow side), ridiculously heavy, and about as old as water oaks ever get. In short, it had to go. A second arborist was a bit less dire, offering that &quot;with trimming it might last a couple of years more, but it&rsquo;s still a 50-50 roll of the dice whether it&rsquo;s going to crash into your house at some point.&quot; </p>

The tree was genuinely dangerous, more so to me than to them, and it is not at all impossible that their prodding me out of my denial was an act that saved my life, or Billy&rsquo;s, or those of the dogs. </td>

<p>But it was a sad decision to have it removed: I loved the tree for its beauty alone, but I had built up a story in my mind that &ndash; though it relied on conjecture and assumption &ndash; added to my sentimentalism about this tree in particular: A dear (and dearly departed) neighbor, Rosa Edwards, lived in Jon and Becca&rsquo;s house next door until the early years of this century. Not wishing to waste the opportunity to learn from someone who so embodied &quot;living history,&quot; I peppered (maybe pestered) her with questions whenever I could. Ms. Edwards had lived in the neighborhood for her entire life, at that house for most of it. She worshiped at Ebenezer Baptist Church and had known the King family when Michael Luther King, Sr. (as he was known before he changed his and his son&rsquo;s names from &quot;Michael&quot; to &quot;Martin&quot;) was the family&rsquo;s most well-known member. So entrenched was she in these pages of history that she had even babysat young &quot;M.L.&quot; (as the civil rights icon was known in his childhood).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where my imagination took over. Though I never thought to ask for confirmation about my assumption, I leapt to the conclusion that Ms. Edwards had done this babysitting in her own house, next door to mine. I imagined the child, who would grow up to have a national holiday named for him, sitting in her backyard, resting up against the oak tree on the property line, doing his homework or memorizing songs or playing games. And so I began to call it, as I did in the title here, the &quot;MLK Tree.&quot;</p>
<p>It all may be a product of my imagination. And in any event, it is completely unverifiable at this point. But others seem eager to latch on to the story. Every time I have shared this speculation, even with all of the caveats regarding uncertainty, my listeners have left with a conviction that Martin Luther King, Jr. played under the tree in my yard. Even the man who would eventually remove it said, &quot;I bet Martin Luther King <i>climbed</i> that tree! It would have been about the right size back then.&quot;</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s true. But even if it&rsquo;s not, I hated to lose the tree.</p>

<p>But time is a brutal master, and this summer time brought with it drenching rains that ended the city&rsquo;s years-long drought. Our floods were severe enough to make the international news, and were later determined to be significantly worse than what would be necessary to qualify as a 500-year flood (500 years being the maximum time period for which such assessments are made). Rising water wasn&rsquo;t an issue, as my house is <span class="dropnote">at the top of a hill</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>, but I worried more and more about what would happen if the tree couldn&rsquo;t hold on to the waterlogged earth below it.</p>

					It used to be my neighbor&rsquo;s house that was at the very top of that hill, but that changed with the removal of the tree: The chips piled up from the tree&rsquo;s branches were spread throughout the back yard &ndash; but even so they were enough to raise the ground level by over
