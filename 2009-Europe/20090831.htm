</script>
	<p>As you may already know, I maintain a &ldquo;<a href="../RegrettablyMissed/default.htm">Regrettably Missed</a>&rdquo; list of things that just didn&rsquo;t pan out, for one reason or another, on my trips. Usually, it&rsquo;s weather or scheduling or some mishap that could not be anticipated. But this morning I lost the opportunity to see the Aalsmeer Flower Auction because I forgot to set the alarm. I was pissed at myself the second I realized what I had done. And as of this writing, my self-directed aggravation hasn&rsquo;t faded.</p>
	<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s what I missed: The Aalsmeer Flower Auction is just what the name implies: an auction of blooms in the Amsterdam suburb of Aalsmeer. But it&rsquo;s not just any auction, it&rsquo;s the largest such auction of its kind, taking place in what Wikipedia identifies as the second-largest building in the world, at 
	  <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "990,000 m&sup2;", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "10,700,000 sq. ft.", false);</script>. And the auctions themselves are supposed to be amazing: Observed from catwalks above the floor, they are in a &ldquo;Dutch auction&rdquo; style, in which an initial price is displayed for a block of goods, dropping rapidly until one bidder locks in at the current level for the entire lot. This system is quite clever, completing the auction in the minimum time possible, assuring the seller of the highest price that anyone is willing to pay, and avoiding the irrational behavior that comes with bids and counter-bids.</p>

    Our original plan had been to take the train out to Weesp, rent bicycles at the station there, and bike over to Muiden and Naarden. Unfortunately, Billy&rsquo;s hip had been bothering him from the moment our plane landed, so an alternate strategy was in order.</p>
	<p>One of the advertisements in a pile of papers we received from Tourist Info. was for a scooter rental place near the Leidseplein. So Billy and I made our way back up the now-familiar tram line, and then over to Marnixstraat where Gilex, the scooter rental establishment, was located. There we made our arrangements with a gentleman who outfitted us with two scooters that made up for in garish yellowness what they lacked in power. And he told us with pride that helmets are not required in the Netherlands. When we replied that we thought helmets were a good idea even if not required, and that we&rsquo;d like a couple if they were available, he looked at us in the same way that he might have done had we asked for a sidecar for our unicorn. But, satisfying himself that we were not actually insane (or that it wasn&rsquo;t a battle worth fighting), he went digging in a supply closet (after moving the pile of things that were blocking access to it) to find helmets for us.</p>
	<p>He also explained the rules of the road in the Netherlands: Because our scooters had blue tags, they were considered bicycles in the eyes of the law, and therefore had to use the bicycle lanes (which meant that we were also forbidden, like bicycles, from streets that <i>lacked</i> bicycle lanes). He explained that we should look at the bicycle directional signs (red on white) to follow our route, rather than the standard version for motorists (white on blue); see below. It is for this reason that my location descriptions on this page are the bicycle version for the locations we accessed by scooter.</p>

So we embarked on what was to become one of the more exasperating experiences of my travel career. The initial third of the journey went pretty well &ndash; but then the bicycle signs petered out. (And I&rsquo;m pretty sure they actually disappeared, as we backtracked twice to the last one we remembered, followed it, and never saw another.)</p>
	<p>So we turned to our tried-and-true approach: interacting with the locals. Thus began a cascade of pleasant, but ultimately unhelpful, interactions. Following are the things that were communicated to us:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>I don&rsquo;t speak English, and I strongly recommend that you ask someone else. (Communicated largely in gesture, this was by far the most common response.)</li>
	  <li>I speak English, but can&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</li>
	  <li>I speak English, but I&rsquo;ve never heard of Muiderslot.</li>
	  <li>I speak English and I know of Muiderslot, ...
	    <ul>
	    	<li>but I have no idea how to get there.</li>
	    	<li>but I only know how to get there by expressway, <span class="dropnote">not by bicycle/scooter</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.</li>
	    	<li>and it&rsquo;s in <i>that</i> direction. (Sent us in a direction where the first sign pointed us back in the direction that we started from.)</li>
	    	<li>and, while I don&rsquo;t know how to get there, I can absolutely assure you it is <i>not</i> in <i>that</i> direction. (A conviction she felt based on her knowledge of the direction of the coast and the direction of the town; I feel absolutely certain that she was not trying to screw us &ndash; but, as it turns out, it <i>was</i> in that direction.)</li>
    	</ul>
      </li>

	<p>Now here&rsquo;s the thing: The place we were trying to go to was Muiderslot (a castle that nearly every Dutch schoolchild has been marched through on multiple field trips), near Muiden (an important and well-known suburb of Amsterdam). Part of the problem, apparently, was my pronunciation: The <i>ui</i> in both names is a complicated phoneme that doesn&rsquo;t exactly match any sound in English (but it&rsquo;s pretty close to the <i>ou</i> in &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;). In IPA, Muiderslot is written as 
<script>LangBoxJ("IPA", "/mœːdəɾslɔt/");</script>, and I tried earnestly to express that vowel in exactly the way that the Dutch did &ndash; but the vast majority of my interactees met my bleating with vacant stares. There is one thing I learned from studying Arabic which may be applicable to Dutch: Such a small number of people learn the language that the natives don&rsquo;t build lot of experience at making sense of foreign accents, so they genuinely can&rsquo;t figure out what you&rsquo;re saying if you don&rsquo;t get it <i>exactly, perfectly</i> right. So I know this is an unfair comparison, because I speak a language where we get <i>a lot</i> of practice working out foreign accents, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite shed a low-level annoyance that was rooted in the fact that, if someone came up to me and said &ldquo;Can you help me find Stone M<u>oo</u>ntain,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s damn likely I&rsquo;d be able to work out what they were talking about.</p>
	<p>And it&rsquo;s not just speaking: I actually wrote it for several of these people, and they still shrugged their shoulders. And I know they weren&rsquo;t just being jerks, because several of them engaged us in extended and pleasant conversations.</p>
	<p>Adding a layer of complexity to the problem is that we lost the trail near a train station called Muider<u>poort</u>, and a couple of people sent us there when we asked directions to Muider<u>slot</u>. But I&rsquo;m not going to take any responsibility for <i>that</i>: Even though I don&rsquo;t speak Dutch, I am absolutely certain that I didn&rsquo;t butcher the pronunciation enough that &ldquo;slot&rdquo; could be confused with &ldquo;poort.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Finally, just to put the icing on my cake of frustration, it is important to note that we are not talking large distances. The distance from the Gilex offices to Muiden is 
	  <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "18.5 km", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "11.5 mi.", false);</script> 
	&ndash; shorter than the distance from downtown Atlanta to Six Flags, Vinings, Perimeter Mall, Clarkston, or even the airport. And remember, we had already covered a third of that by the time we started asking directions. We were closer to Muiden than downtown Atlanta is to Lenox Square, but most of the people we talked to either had never even heard of it or had no clue how to get to it!</p>
	<p>We finally got past this impediment by following the advice of one woman who told that that she was very uncertain, but thought it <i>might</i> be &ldquo;that way&rdquo; (and she pointed), which took us in complete contrariness to the instructions of another woman who said it absolutely, definitively was <i>not</i> that way. It <i>was</i>, of course, that way &ndash; and when we got to the next major intersection, the missing directionals reappeared. This took us to Muiden, where people suddenly could understand me when I said &ldquo;Muiderslot.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Anyway, we did finally get to <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Muiderslot");LangBoxJ("EN", "Castle Muiden");</script>, which was totally worth the trouble. It is a small, almost dainty, castle &ndash; smaller, indeed, than even the <span class="dropnote">tiniest IKEA</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. But, like most Dutch architecture, Muiderslot is absolutely perfect in its proportions.</p>

	<p>We parked the scooters, paid our admission, and then crossed the <span class="dropnote">moat</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> into the castle. And then we entered the central courtyard.</p>

	<p>Billy and I took a tour of the former residential area, the most notable resident of which was Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, a beloved Dutch writer who spent his summers in the castle and there organized the <script>LangBoxJ("NL", "Muiderkring");LangBoxJ("EN", "Muiden Circle");</script>, a group of prominent artists and scientists (both men and women, BTW), of the Dutch <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Golden Age");LangBoxJ("NL", "Gouden Eeuw");</script>. Indeed, this was not our first exposure to Hooft on the trip. In navigating to the r&#x0133;sttafel restaurant on the first day of our visit, the cross street we were looking for after exiting the tram was P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Hooftstraat. Apparently he was quite a decent chap, as every piece of information I&rsquo;ve found about him is full of praise. It bears mention that his motto, carved in enormous letters on the mantle above the fireplace in his bedroom, was <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "&laquo;Omnibus Idem&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;The Same for Everyone&rdquo;");</script>.</p>
	<p>Billy rested in the courtyard while I took a couple of self-guided tours of the ramparts and armories and such. And then he talked me into leaving Muiderslot (reluctantly) so we could grab some lunch.</p>
	<p>And lunch was fantastic: We sat at an outdoor caf&eacute;, alongside a swing bridge and active docks. So several times during our meal, the bells would ring to indicate to traffic that the bridge would soon be sliding away, and then a boat or two would quickly make their way through the locks. It would drive me crazy to <i>live</i> next to it, but having <i>lunch</i> next to it was spectacular.</p>
	<p>As for the meal, the only interesting thing we had was hegelslag, a dessert sandwich in which the diner assembles the ingredients in the proportions desired from what is brought on a tray: white bread, a box of chocolate shavings, and butter. It&rsquo;s absolutely brilliant.</p>

After lunch, we made our way to Naarden, seeing some gorgeous countryside along the way, with cows  and sheep in unfenced fields lined by tiny canals. We drove along a  sea dike much of the way (which actually wasn&rsquo;t very pretty; it just looked like an earthen embankment that blocked our view of the water; I kept hoping for the trail to move to the top of the dike, but it never did).</p>
	<p>Naarden is an old Dutch fortified town surrounded by a moat and a double-wall defense system. It claims to be the first capital of the Netherlands. And while it is clear in reading of this assertion that other points of view can be found, the city is indisputably historic: Founded in tenth century as Naruthi (meaning &ldquo;near a small river&rdquo;) it moved to its present location in 1350 to avoid the encroaching swampland to its south.</p>
<p>Built in the &ldquo;star fort&rdquo; arrangement (which offered no &ldquo;dead zones&rdquo; along the walls in which an invader could take refuge) Naarden looks absolutely amazing in a satellite view (see pictures to right), but we found it a bit sleepy at ground level: The town has dedicated itself to an art scene, with numerous galleries within its walls rather than (as I would have preferred) quaint shops with unique items that might appeal to the tourist (e.g., wooden shoes). Still, we enjoyed the environment, and had a nice ice cream cone on its largely deserted central street.</p>
	<p>The main church is known by two names: The 
		<script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Great Church");LangBoxJ("NL", "Grote Kerk");</script> and <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "St. Vitus Church");LangBoxJ("NL", "Sint-Vituskerk");</script>. It would have been nice to see inside, as we could have done if we had tried to enter before walking around &ndash; but as it was, we heard them latch the door from the inside just as we were approaching, and only then noticed the 16:00 closing time.</p>
<p>Naarden&rsquo;s most famous permanent resident is the Czech philosopher <script>LangBoxJ("CS", "Jan Amos Komensk&yacute;");LangBoxJ("NL", "Jan Amos Comenius");LangBoxJ("EN", "John Amos Comenius");</script>, interred in the Great Church. While the reasons are lost to time that Naarden was chosen as the philosopher&rsquo;s final resting place, the site remains one of intense interest to the Czech people: In the early part of the 20th century, his mausoleum was deeded to Czechoslovakia for the amount of 1ƒ per year. This arrangement was destroyed by World War II, the Cold War, and the post-Cold War division of Czechoslovakia, but even to this day the site remains dear to the hearts of the Czech people, and still serves as a shrine to which Czechs make pilgrimages. Comenius&rsquo;s image appears on the obverse of the Czech Republic&rsquo;s 200 korun banknote (value is <script>MeasurementBoxJ("CZK", "200 Kč", true);MeasurementBoxJ("EUR", "&euro;&nbsp;7.64", false);MeasurementBoxJ("USD", "$11.47", false);</script>&nbsp;), with an overview of Naarden behind him.</p>

    Having finished our day of siteseeing, all we had left to do was to get the scooters back to Gilex. The task was pretty easy once I realized that &ldquo;Amsterdam&rdquo; was abbreviated as &ldquo;A&rsquo;dam&rdquo; on all the signs. And we did, indeed, lose the trail a couple of times on the way back. But at least this time everyone had heard of Amsterdam and could point me in the direction of it.</p>
	<p>After dropping off the scooters, we took the tram back to de Dam, and had a forgettable supper. I did try a dessert version of pannenkoeken (with chocolate sauce). It was a nice try as a local discovery,  but I doubt I would seek these out in a place other than their homeland.</p>
	<p>Finally, we repaired to the Vita Nova to try to sleep, which was difficult for me as I lay tossing and turning with visions of every conceivable planning disaster running through my mind. As you may remember from the first day of this trip report, marijuana exposure from simply walking the streets of Amsterdam compounded on itself until I was eventually overcome with paranoia. This was the night that it happened. Fortunately, I figured out what the problem was, and with that comprehension I was able to put it aside in my consciousness and fall asleep.</p>
