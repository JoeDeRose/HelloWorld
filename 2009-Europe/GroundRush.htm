<h1>Ground Rush</h1>
<p>It so happens that I am frequently given the opportunity for personal growth in the form of a comprehensive disquisition of my failings by associates who claim (and who make every effort to demonstrate) a thorough understanding of the subject. While the variety of topics has been breathtaking, never yet has the complaint been lodged that my organizational skills are wanting. (Nor that my English vocuabulary is substandard; everything else, I think, has been covered.)</p>
<p>Even so, I approach every major trip with layer upon layer of doubt: Did I forget any reservations? Did I pick the right date; the right day; the right year? Did I enter the correct airport codes (or will I make international news like those people who accidentally booked a vacation trip to Sydney, <i>Canada</i>)? Is my penchant for offbeat hotel rooms going to introduce us to geographical inconvenience, unsound architecture, or unwelcome creatures in the bedding? Have I underestimated swine flu? If Billy's kidney fails, how will I get him home? Will we have trouble meeting Mom in Paris? Will we get bored on the train? Did I really double check that my appliances can accept European voltage, or did I only dream that I did so? </p>
