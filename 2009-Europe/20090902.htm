<p>In the 1990s, Dean Kamen was working on a brilliant and noble project &#8211; a wheelchair with such a powerful combination of computers, sensors, and mechanics, that it would revolutionize the relationship between wheelchair users and the world to which they were all too often merely <span class="dropnote">bystanders</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.</p>

<p>This phenomenal new wheelchair would have the same four wheels that one finds on powered chairs already &#8211; but these would have a central chassis that would allow the wheels to rotate over each other, letting the user climb curbs, and even stairs. It would be rugged enough that the user could go &#8220;off-road,&#8221; joining friends on dirt trails or sand, and even go through as much as <script>MeasurementBoxJ("US", "3&quot;", true);MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "7.6 cm", false);</script> 
of standing water. And most amazingly, the wheels could align themselves vertically, thus raising the user to the point that she or he could have an eye-level conversation with someone, or reach a high shelf without assistance. Key to some of these innovations was a sophisticated gyroscopic feedback unit that enabled the wheelchair to balance, and even respond to the user&rsquo;s subtle positional changes &#8211; whether they be deliberate or accidental.</p>
<p>The wheelchair was code-named &#8220;Fred.&#8221; And when Dean Kamen had the idea of marketing a version of this vehicle for use in a standing position, that companion project was code-named &#8220;Ginger&#8221; &#8211; an homage in naming to the unparalleled footwork of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. &#8220;Fred&#8221; danced into the marketplace as the iBOT Mobility System. And a few years later, &#8220;Ginger&#8221; whirled in, as the Segway <span class="dropnote">HT</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.</p>

<p>If you have read through my previous trip reports, you will know that I seek out divers vehicles with the same enthusiasm that I seek out unusual hotels (and sometimes the vehicles just find me). This has introduced me and Billy some particularly odd conveyances over the years:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A gondola in Venice;</li>
	<li>A rowboat off the coast of Capri;</li>
	<li>A single-seat chairlift to the summit of Monte Solaro in Capri;</li>
	<li>An &#8220;Elektro Taxi&#8221; in Zermatt;</li>
	<li>A bulldozer in Gornergrat (where we were met at the train station and shuttled to our hotel in the front scoop);</li>
	<li>A paraglider back down the mountain to Zermatt;</li>
	<li>A zip line over a lake in Cob&aacute;;</li>
	<li>Rapelling down a cliff in Tres Reyes;</li>
	<li>A donkey in Fira;</li>
	<li>A sherut in Jerusalem (a shared taxi, which wouldn&rsquo;t merit a slot on this list except that <i>I</i> was driving it);</li>
	<li>A camel in Petra;</li>
	<li>A cal&egrave;che in Luxor; and (among others that might have deserved to be here)</li>
	<li>A felucca in Aswan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus it was with unbridled delight that I faced the prospect of riding a Segway. Billy approached it with less eagerness, but by the end of the morning, he was trying to figure out how to buy one. These are simply amazing machines.</p>
<p>And to top it off, the day was perfect. I have a lot of days during vacations when the weather is pleasant, the company is good, and the experiences are memorable. This was above that: The weather was gorgeous. The experience of riding a Segway (a long-time goal of mine) was hitched to a tour of Paris sites that was both deeply researched and enthusiastically presented by a guide who adored his adopted home and wanted to share it with others. And Billy and I both enjoyed the experience enormously, as well as the company of a family who were also in our group. They were Canadians on a lengthy tour of the world to celebrate the husband&rsquo;s fiftieth birthday. As we met them, they were winding up a tour that included some of the places high on my itinerary, which they had approached with a similar travel style to my own: Immersing themselves in cultures and experiences, and covering both depth and distance with equal gusto. And they were amusing: They had just arrived in Paris from a rural Dutch town in which the church bell is rung a hundred times at 7 in the morning &#8211; every single day &#8211; in honor of the World War II dead. They remarked that it was profoundly meaningful the first day; seemed deeply penitential by the second day; and pushed them near rage for the rest of their time there.</p>
<p>Taking the tour on our first full day in Paris was also good for establishing our orientation to the city. Unfortunately, as you can see, I didn&rsquo;t take many pictures; there were a few reasons for this: (1) It was impossible, of course, to take a picture while on the Segway. (2) At the places we stopped, I wanted to hear the guide speak about what we were seeing, and not to distract myself with picture taking. (3) I knew I would be coming back to almost all of these places, and that I would have more time on foot, later, to seek out the best vantage point and framing of the shot. I did, however, take a few pictures: the two you see in this section, and a handful of others that I put in other areas of this report.</p>
<p><img src="20090902/logo-ft.jpg" class="PictureFloatRight" />So here&rsquo;s how the morning went: We arrived on schedule at 9:30 AM at the Eiffel Tower&rsquo;s 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pilier sud");LangBoxJ("EN", "South Pillar");</script>. Joined by the aforementioned family and another group of tourists, we were greeted by our guide, Seth, who arrived on his Segway. We followed him on foot back to the headquarters of Fat Tire, the bike tour agency that expanded to organize these Segway tours as well. There we signed our releases, contracts, and deposit authorizations, and were outfitted with helmets and Segway PTs &#8211; minus the key device, which Seth kept with him the entire time. (Apparently it&rsquo;s fragile, and we didn&rsquo;t need it because it communicates with the Segway wirelessly.)</p>
<p>Seth spent at least a half-hour (maybe longer) giving us each a one-on-one instruction as to how to perform basic functions on the Seway: stepping up onto it; moving forward; moving backward; standing still; turning; parking against a wall; and stepping down off of it. We were apprised of the damage that could result (both to our bodies and our checkbooks) if we didn&rsquo;t allow clearance for the wheels and got caught on a curb or hit a signpost. And then we spend some time doing figure eights and practice maneuvers. You may wonder, as we did, what would happen if you &quot;put the pedal to the metal&quot; on a Segway, just leaning forward like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on the bow of the <i>Titanic</i>. The answer &#8211; which we were able to test empirically &#8211; is that the Segway will not go on indefinitely, trying to reach warp speed or, failing that, crashing to the earth. Rather, it will outrun you, buck gently, and bring itself to a slower speed. It&rsquo;s really quite a phenomenal contraption!</p>
<script>
WriteParisSignJ(7, "Champs ((de)) Mars");
</script>
<p>Then we headed out onto the sidewalks of Paris, toward our first stop at the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Champs de Mars");LangBoxJ("EN", "Field of Mars");</script>. Nowadays, the Champs de Mars is thought of as the park around the Eiffel Tower &#8211; but its name, taken from the god of war, is appropriate to its grizzly history, which has seen not only military exercises by the cadets of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&Eacute;cole militaire");LangBoxJ("EN", "Military School");</script> 
at its southeast border, but also a number of genuine battles as that institution came under siege.  Seth then showed us an intentional counterpoint to the savagery committed on this field: the 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Mur pour la paix");LangBoxJ("EN", "Wall for Peace");</script> &#8211; a complex sculpture on the Champs de Mars, across from the &Eacute;cole militaire, consisting of a wooden platform, steel columns and roof, and glass panels on which the word &#8220;Peace&#8221; is written in <span class="dropnote">49 different languages</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. The monument is the work of Clara Halter and Jean-Michel Wilmotte, but has been left unfinished: The final portion (the design of which has not yet been revealed) will be added when worldwide peace has been achieved.</p>

					<td>Okay, <span class="PictureCaptionRoman">they</span> say 49 languages. But, if you ask me, the number is actually 48: One of their &#8220;languages&#8221; is braille &#8211; which, of course, isn&rsquo;t a language at all, but rather a script (in case you&rsquo;re interested: code &#8220;Brai&#8221; in the ISO 15924 rubric, which categorizes scripts). In this case they simply transliterated the French word 
						<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "paix");</script> (hover over the braille letters to see the printed character[s] to which they correlate):
<script>
BrailleObject =

WriteBraille(BrailleObject);

<br />If they&rsquo;d transliterated the English word <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "peace");</script> instead, it would look like this:

	        "letter"  : "e"
		}
	];
WriteBraille(BrailleObject);

<br />That&rsquo;s not to belittle their efforts, of course &#8211; just their description. (But I bet blind visitors who spoke any of the other 47 languages might have liked a braille version that <span class="PictureCaptionRoman">they</span> could understand.)

<p>But before we got there, Seth brought us to a halt to provide, <i>in situ</i>, a final important instruction about Segway usage: Quick stops were fine and dandy on pavement. But on the loose sand of the Champs de Mars, a quick stop could cause a skid, which the Segway computer wouldn&rsquo;t know how to interpret. The result would be that the wheels would spin wildly, and that the Champs de Mars, already having soaked up many, many liters of blood in its long history, might get a sip of ours.</p>
<script>
WriteParisSignJ(7, "École // militaire");
WriteParisSignJ(7, "Les // Invalides");
</script>
<p>After the Wall for Peace, Seth turned our attention in the opposite direction, to the &Eacute;cole militaire &#8211; founded by Louis XV and alma mater to Napoleon Bonaparte (who, a prodigy, graduated in one year rather than the standard two).  He showed us bullet pocks throughout the edifice, some from as recent as the second World War.</p>
<p>After the &Eacute;cole militaire, Seth took us up the street to Les Invalides, famous as, among other things, the burial site of Napoleon. I&rsquo;m saving most of the details of this spot (even those that Seth taught me) for the section where I visit Les Invalides on my own, so please forgive my brevity here.</p>
<p>Seth then brought the group around to the side where Les Invalides faces the Seine, and told us about two prominent nearby bridges &#8211; one rife with symbolism above the asphalt, and the other with its symbolism below: First up was the 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pont Alexandre III");LangBoxJ("EN", "Alexandre III Bridge");</script>, easily the most ornate of Paris&rsquo;s river crossings. It was completed in 1900 in honor of the Franco-Russian Alliance of eight years previous, and has several opulent statues at its corners &#8211; the most prominent ones, on <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "17 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "56'", false);</script> 
pillars, are the &quot;fames&quot; of sciences, arts, commerce, and industry. Despite their <span class="dropnote">innocuous names</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>, however, there is an important subtext in their composition. I&rsquo;m fuzzy on the details, but as I remember, one is holding an olive branch (a welcome to the Russians) while another is holding a sword (a warning to them). (The other two, if I remember correctly, honor leaders of the two countries.)</p>

					<td>On the other hand, maybe their names aren&rsquo;t so innocuous after all. Those names came from the English Wikipedia page about the bridge. The French page lists different terms for the latter two: &#8220;combat&#8221; and &#8220;war.&#8221;</td>

<p>The other bridge that Seth wanted us to note was the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pont de la Concorde");LangBoxJ("EN", "Concord Bridge");</script>. The placement of this span is already significant, connecting the Place de la Concorde (more anon, but basically the dominant public square in Paris and the bloody focal point of the Revolution) with the 
<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Palais Bourbon");LangBoxJ("EN", "Bourbon Palace");</script> (which houses the lower chamber of France&rsquo;s bicameral parliament, the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Assemblée nationale");LangBoxJ("EN", "National Assembly");</script>&nbsp;). This bridge&rsquo;s placement gives it a conceptual symbolism that is reinforced by its physical and symbolic foundation: The French Revolution started with the storming of the Bastille prison &#8211; and tourists are often flumoxed when they look for this edifice, of which almost nothing remains. But its stones are here: When the detested prison was razed, its masonry was brought to this site so its function could be transformed &#8211; rather than confine and entomb the people, it would now support and connect them.</p>
<script>
WriteParisSignJ(8, "Place ((de la)) Concorde");
</script>
<p>Our focus was then drawn to the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place de la Concorde");LangBoxJ("EN", "Concord Square");</script> 
itself. Originally called <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place Louis XV");LangBoxJ("EN", "Louis XV Square");</script> and then sporting a tall statue of that monarch in its center, it was renamed <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Place de la R&eacute;volution");LangBoxJ("EN", "Revolution Square");</script> during the bloody Reign of Terror, when, in the center of the square, Louis XV&rsquo;s statue was pulled down and a guillotine was put up &#8211; a device that was given such enthusiastic usage that for some time it averaged more than 40 beheadings a day. This is where countless French citizens passed into eternity &#8211; notable among them:</p>

Louis&rsquo;s conviction of treason was unambiguous, with 693 votes (out of 721) confirming his guilt. But his sentence for death was surprisingly close: 288 votes against the death penalty; 72 in favor, but with delays and conditions; 361 for immediate execution. The majority, though slim, had spoken; so on <script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "2 pluvi&ocirc;se, an I", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "January 21, 1793", false);</script>, he was brought to the Place de la R&eacute;volution for the sentence to be carried out. And just as the National Convention was somewhat equivocal in its judgment, so was the guillotine itself: The blade did not cut through on the first try, and had to be raised for a second attempt before the crowd was allowed to rush forward and dip their handkerchiefs in the blood of Citoyen Louis <span class="dropnote">Capet</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>.</li>

	was, like most women until very recent decades, given guilt without responsibility, blame without self-determination. A daughter in the Austrian royal family, Marie was married, <i>in absentia</i>, to Louis at the age of 14; she met him for the first time a month later, only to discover his deep prejudice against her country &#8211; a view that put her at a disadvantage with her family in Austria (as she was expected to influence French policy to their favor) as well as her new family in France. Never interested in politics, and shut out of them even if she had been, she was still the target of sniping in Versailles, which led to wild accusations that were also taken up by the revolutionaries as the monarchy unraveled: that she had affairs with people who were in fact enemies, and that she sexually abused her own son (a charge that she challenged with such ferocity that the mob was briefly won over to her side). She famously commented to her hairdresser as her enemies mounted in the Second and Third Estates, &#8220;Come, Léonard, dress my hair, I must go like an actress, exhibit myself to a public that may hiss at me.&#8221; But her biggest mistake was that she refused to escape: During the Revolution, she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of any plan that would separate her from her husband. And after Louis XVI&rsquo;s execution &#8211; when she was referred to simply as Prisoner No. 280 &#8211; she still refused to cooperate with any of several attempts to extract her to safety. She was taken to the Place de la R&eacute;volution on 
	<script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "25 vend&eacute;miaire, an II", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "October 16, 1793", false);</script> for her date with the guillotine. In mounting the platform, she accidentally stepped on the executioner&rsquo;s foot, and even amidst these circumstances was at pains to let him know that it was not intentional; the last words of 
		<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "veuve Capet");LangBoxJ("EN", "Widow Capet");</script> were,

An appeal was made to allow him to continue his experiments, but was rejected summarily by the courts, who opined, &#8220;The Republic needs neither scientists nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.&#8221; The sentence was carried out on <script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "19 flor&eacute;al, an II", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "May 8, 1794", false);</script>.

	<li><b>Maximilien Robespierre:</b> <i>Maximilien Fran&ccedil;ois Marie Isidore de Robespierre</i> learned that those who live by the sword, die by the sword. And, like nearly 100% of the people who learn this lesson, he learned it too late to do him any good. Originally an opponent of the death penalty, he argued that, in one specific case, Louis XVI must die so that a hundred thousand virtuous citizens may live. Later, he became a prime architect of <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "the Reign of Terror");LangBoxJ("FR", "la Terreur");</script>, solid in his belief that swiftness in judgment was far, far more important than certainty, and that terror was a form of virtue because without it virtue is impotent. Political winds changed, and Robespierre was declared an outlaw. While hiding from the National Convention, he shattered his jaw in a suicide attempt with a pistol, and then was held in the same cell that Marie Antoinette had been locked in while she awaited the identical fate. The next morning, on
<script>MeasurementBoxJ("RE", "10 thermidor, an II", true);MeasurementBoxJ("NS", "July 28, 1794", false);</script>, he was taken to Place de la R&eacute;volution without a trial and presented to the executioner.</li>

<p>One person who didn&rsquo;t die in the Place de la R&eacute;volution, however, was Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, inventor of the device. It is often said that his demise was effected by his most famous invention, and indeed he was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror, on a trajectory that would have led him, in a tumbrel, to the Place de la R&eacute;volution. But when Ropespiere fell from power, and found his own date on that square, Dr. Guillotin was freed. He invented the device, by the way, because of his steadfast conviction against any form of capital punishment: He believed that by creating a quick and painless mechanism for execution, that he could move his country in the direction of abolishing capital punishment entirely. His wishes came to fruition almost 200 years later, on October 9, 1981, when France became the <i>last</i> nation in Western Europe to abolish the death penalty. The guillotine was the mechanism of execution to the very end, having been used as recently as September 10, 1977 in the execution of Hamida Djandoubi for the torture-murder of his former girlfriend.</p>

							  <td>As I read back over my text above, I can hear John&rsquo;s voice in my head: &#8220;You&rsquo;ve painted a sympathetic picture of the monarchy, and a harsh picture of Revolution. Just what political perspective are you going for?&#8221;<br />
							  	<br />
							  	That&rsquo;s a good question, John. The French aristocracy were undoubtedly tyrants, although the same could be said for the early leaders of the Revolution. Indeed, Louis-S&eacute;bastien Mercier referred to Robespierre as a &#8220;Sanguinocrat&#8221; (from the French word for blood). But I will acknowledge &#8211; and defend &#8211; the position that the French Revolution, despite some early hiccups, was in general an enormous force for good, both for France and for the world.<br />
							  	<br />
							  	But to answer John&rsquo;s question (and don&rsquo;t doubt me; it <i>would</i> have been John&rsquo;s question): My primary perspective is not really political at all &#8211; just a conviction that every person&rsquo;s life is a story that&rsquo;s worth telling. But there <i>is</i> a political aspect as well in my distrust of capital punishment, as it cuts away the endings of those stories. I simply cannot bring myself to believe that any person is completely irredeemable. And even when we fail to bring the criminal to redemption, when we let her or him fade away in a prison hospital because trust could never be restored, we at least learn something of the process of redemption in the failure &#8211; we learn the result of our interactions; we learn what didn&rsquo;t work; we advance our understanding in the context of the scientific method.<br />
								<br />
							  	So I think Guillotin had it wrong: By making capital punishment quick and painless, we don&rsquo;t move in the direction of abolition at all. Rather, in doing so, we make it all too easy to give up hope for a certain criminal&rsquo;s redemption. And just as it&rsquo;s far easier to buy ground beef in a supermarket package than it is to bleed the animal and scrape its bones, it&rsquo;s also far easier to put someone to death when the execution isn&rsquo;t punctuated by the criminal&rsquo;s screams. But (in both grocery shopping and capital punishment) ease of our task shouldn&rsquo;t be our foremost consideration. By cutting away the individual, we cut away a little of ourselves in the process. And by making it easy, we cut away a little more.</td>

<p>Seth then had us skirt the north side of the 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Jardin des Tuileries");LangBoxJ("EN", "Tuileries Garden");</script> 
	(inside of which Segways are forbidden apparently), and then had us walk our Segways to a restaurant where we ate under the chestnuts in the middle of the garden. I think the restaurant was Chalet de Diane &#8211; but, whatever it was, I had a delicious gallette with sausages.</p>
<p>After lunch, we began our final leg &#8211; back to the Fat Tire HQ to return our Segways and end our tour. This took us past the 
	<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Grand Palais");LangBoxJ("EN", "Big Palace");</script> and the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Petit Palais");LangBoxJ("EN", "Small Palace");</script>
	, built simultaneously across the street from each other, and across the Seine from Les Invalides. These are two beautiful buildings in the Beaux Arts style, currently housing museums and temporary exhibitions.</p>
<p>Then, as we moved back toward headquarters along the banks of the Seine, disaster struck: The son of the Canadian couple strayed from the path toward a tree. He was able to pull back and make what amounted to an abrupt stop, but the appearance of a crash panicked his father, who attempted to jump from his Segway and run to his son. The Segway bucked against the strange inputs it was given, whirled, and slammed him and itself into a different tree at much faster than an abrupt stop.</p>
<p>Now, Princess Diana had a bad crash in a tunnel very near this same spot; it was nothing like that at all. But, still, it was pretty bad: He was cut, bruised, and had at least one broken finger. The rest of us ambled around nervously while Seth tried to get an ambulance to the scene. And during this ambling, the couple &#8211; realizing that they would be spending their last night in Paris, not at the Louvre as expected, but in the hospital &#8211; very graciously and generously offered their Lourvre tickets to me and Billy. We tried to talk them out of it, saying that even if there was a shred of hope that they could keep their appointment, that they should have the tickets on hand. But they insisted that this wouldn&rsquo;t be possible and that we should have them.</p>
<p>The father was taken away &#8211; but the ambulance was not able to transport the whole group, so the rest of his family and the rest of us then made our way, quite somberly, back to Fat Tire headquarters. </p>

<p>Billy invited Mom to take his ticket, and she eagerly accepted, so in the early afternoon she and I headed back out to see the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Mus&eacute;e du Louvre");LangBoxJ("EN", "Louvre Museum");</script>, known officially (but almost never) as the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Grand Louvre");LangBoxJ("EN", "Great Louvre");</script>. This took me finally on my preferred way of traveling in Paris: the M&eacute;tro. Paris&rsquo;s M&eacute;tro is a bit of an odd duck in the subway world: On five of the lines, the trains run on rubber tires instead of rails. And until the summer of 1991, the system ran separate first- and second-class cars. But it&rsquo;s a joy to ride: cheap, pleasant, and efficient.</p>
<p>We exited the M&eacute;tro at the <b>Palais Royale &#8211; Mus&eacute;e du Louvre</b> station and made our way underground to the entrance beneath the iconic <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pyramide du Louvre");LangBoxJ("EN", "Louvre Pyramid");</script> in the Louvre&rsquo;s <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cour Napol&eacute;on");LangBoxJ("EN", "Napoleon Courtyard");</script>. Luminaries as far back as the courtyard&rsquo;s namesake had dreamed of putting a pyramid of some sort in this space, but the goal was not achieved until 1989, when the current design, by I.M. Pei, was brought to life.  As with many of their most-cherished monuments, the citizens of Paris hated it at first (despite the fact that what it replaced was a parking lot), but came to accept it as a beautiful and essential part of their city scene.</p>
<p>Of special fascination to me was that the underground walk to the museum entrance also took us past the downward-pointing <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Pyramide Invers&eacute;e");LangBoxJ("EN", "Inverted Pyramid");</script>, which Pei designed as a counterpoint to the larger, upward-pointing main pyramid. The Inverted Pyramid comes to about <script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "1 m", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "3.3'", false);</script> 
above the floor of the walkway below, and is nearly met by its own counterpoint: a small upward-pointing pyramid immediately below it. And while the main pyramid attracted <i>initial</i> controversy because of how it&rsquo;s architectural design interacts with the environment, the Inverted Pyramid has attracted <i>ongoing</i> controversy because of how it&rsquo;s architectural design interacts with history: It first drew the attention of a pair of writers on the subject of Masonic institutions: <span class="dropnote">Dominique Setzepfandt</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> held that the Inverted Pyramid and the smaller one below it echoed the Masonic square and compass that form the seal of Solomon. And Rapha&euml;l Aurillac put forth in his work, <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "<i>Le guide du Paris ma&ccedil;onnique</i>");LangBoxJ("EN", "<i>The Guide to Masonic Paris</i>");</script>, that the Louvre was once a Masonic temple, and that the Inverted Pyramid expressed the Masonic motto &#8220;V.I.T.R.I.O.L.,&#8221; <script>LangBoxJ("LA", "Visita Interiorem Terrae Rectificandoque Invenies Occultum Lapidem");LangBoxJ("EN", "Visit the Interior of the Earth and You Will Find the Secret Stone");</script>. Most famously to date, Dan Brown presented in his fictitious work, <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, that the smaller pyramid underneath the glass structure was the apex of a mostly-buried pyramid that holds the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene.</p>

<p>If you ask me, though, the pyramid is the only thing holy in what is otherwise an abomination: What you don&rsquo;t get from the books, or from most photographs of the place, is that the Inverted Pyramid is the centerpiece of the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Carrousel du Louvre");</script> &#8211; an underground shopping mall. While it connects to a place where art is sacred, the only shrine here is to raw capitalism.</p>
<p>Nine hundred years ago, the Louvre was a fortress of <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Philip II of France");LangBoxJ("FR", "Philippe II de France");</script>. Four hundred years ago, it was the palace of the House of Bourbon. Three hundred years ago, it housed the royal collection, after the monarchy had vacated Paris to Versailles. Two hundred years ago, it had been opened to the public by the Revolution, and had artists living in the hallways, hanging their own works frame-to-frame with the artistic holdings of the Bourbon kings. Seventy years ago, the finest pieces in the collection were being spirited away in nondescript moving vans to protect those treasures from the German advance. Today, the collection has been restored and expanded, and it is widely perceived as the finest museum in the world.</p>
<p>So Mom and I made our way into the museum &#8211; first to the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Denon Wing");LangBoxJ("FR", "Aile Denon");</script>, which houses a substantial portion of the things that I failed to learn about in several art history classes throughout my academic career.</p>

<p>Now have you heard about the rule of thirds? In short, it holds that one should mentally divide an image into a uniform 3&times;3 tic-tac-toe grid, and should compose the image so that major elements fall along the dividing lines (and especially at the intersections). For portraits, it is generally held that the subject&rsquo;s eyes should line up with the upper horizontal line, and that the horizon should also be on that line or on the lower one.</p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci hadn&rsquo;t heard of it (because it wasn&rsquo;t invented yet). And that&rsquo;s why he painted the Mona Lisa in a pyramidic compositional style that would have earned, at best, scrutiny in a twenty-first-century art class. But despite having violated one of the most basic precepts of composition, da Vinci managed to scratch out a picture that some think is the most beautiful in the world.</p>

<p>The <i>Mona Lisa</i>, it should be noted,  has been through a lot, and has emerged in remarkably good shape considering its history. In 1911 it was stolen by an Italian nationalist and Louvre employee, Vincenzo Peruggia, who felt that it should be <span class="dropnote">repatriated to Italy</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. Peruggia hid in a closet on a Sunday, and simply walked out with the painting under his coat (after extracting it from its frame) on the following Monday, when the museum was closed with only a small number of employees on the grounds &#8211; a strategy that was possible because of the painting&rsquo;s relatively small size at 
<script>MeasurementBoxJ("SI", "77 cm&times;53 cm", true);MeasurementBoxJ("US", "30&quot;&times;21&quot;", false);</script>, but not as easy as it might have been, since the <i>Mona Lisa</i> is painted on wood rather than canvas. It was only when he tried to sell it to the Uffizi that he was discovered and prosecuted. The painting&rsquo;s return to France, however, was delayed while it was exhibited triumphantly throughout Italy &#8211; but in 1913 the <i>Mona Lisa</i> hung again in the Louvre. Peruggia served a short sentence (having been extended leniency in the Italian courts because of his nationalistic goals); eventually he married and returned to France where he operated a paint store (which sounds ironic, but probably isn&rsquo;t). The painting&rsquo;s worst year to date was 1956, when it was damaged first by a vandal who doused it with acid, then by another who chipped its paint with a rock. Now it sits behind bulletproof glass, which has protected it from more recent attacks: spray paint in 1974 when it was on loan to the Tokyo National Museum, and, exactly one month before our visit, an attack with a terra cotta teacup that cracked the case but left the painting undamaged (making you wonder exactly how &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; that glass really is).</p>

<p>Our route to the <i>Mona Lisa</i> took us past <i>Madonna of the Rocks</i>, more properly known as <i><script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Virgin of the Rocks");LangBoxJ("FR", "La Vierge aux rochers");</script></i>, which figured so prominently in the <i>Da Vinci Code</i>. Most surprising to me about this work was its inconspicuousness in light of its fame &#8211; just hanging on a crowded wall of paintings, but attracting one&rsquo;s attention in the crowd as would the face of a celebrity.</p>
<p>And after the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, we went to see <i><script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Winged Victory of Samothrace");LangBoxJ("FR", "Victoire de Samothrace");</script></i>. Now perhaps you&rsquo;re wondering why she&rsquo;s &#8220;Winged Victory&#8221; in English, but just &#8220;Victory&#8221; in French; the answer may be that she was only half-winged when they got their hands on her. The right wing is simply a plaster cast to mirror the original wing on her left.</p>
<p><i>Winged Victory</i> sits on a massive pedestal in an atrium  at the top of the Louvre&rsquo;s Daru staircase &#8211; which is apparently a very important architectural feature of the museum. I remember being impressed with it at the time &#8211; but if I&rsquo;d known that it had a name, I&rsquo;d have taken a picture that reflected the grandeur of the staircase itself, independent of the statue at its summit. Maybe next time.</p>
<p>After <i>Winged Victory</i>, we struggled a bit to figure out what level we were on &#8211; and after solving that mystery went to the adjacent <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Sully Wing");LangBoxJ("FR", "Aile Sully");</script> of the Louvre to its most famous piece, the <i><script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Venus de Milo");LangBoxJ("FR", "V&eacute;nus de Milo");</script></i>, also known as <i>Aphrodite of Milos</i>. Several people lost their lives in the process of bringing this work to the Louvre &#8211; not in the excavation or transport; but rather in the sale: It seems that France dragged its feet in completing the agreed-upon deal. The Greek peasants who discovered this masterpiece tried to trade it to the Ottoman Empire instead, and worked out an agreement to that end. France showed up at the last minute and demanded the statue in line with the promises, plans, and payments that had already been worked out. And the Ottomans took in blood what they had lost in marble.</p>
<p>Even so, the French didn&rsquo;t really cherish this statue until they had lost their favorite alternative, the <i>
	<script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Venus de&rsquo; Medici");LangBoxJ("FR", "V&eacute;nus de M&eacute;dicis");</script></i>. Unlike the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, the <i>Venus de&rsquo; Medici</i> really <i>had</i> been looted from Italy by Napoleon (so, if it had still been there, perhaps this is the work that Vincenzo Peruggia would have lugged out under his coat in 1911). In 1815 France returned the <i>Venus de&rsquo; Medici</i>, and initiated a propaganda campaign to elevate the <i>Venus de Milo</i> as a greater treasure than the one they had lost. Compare for yourself:</p>

<p>Finally, Mom and I each had a single remaining agenda item.  She wanted to see Michelangelo&rsquo;s sculpture, <i><script>LangBoxJ("EN", "The Dying Slave");LangBoxJ("FR", "L&rsquo;Esclave mourant");</script></i>. And I was keen to see the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Napoleon III Apartments");LangBoxJ("FR", "Appartements Napol&eacute;on III");</script>, which Seth had mentioned on the Segway tour.</p>
<p><i>The Dying Slave</i> was near our starting point, but the apartments took us over to the
<script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Richelieu Wing");LangBoxJ("FR", "Aile Richelieu");</script> (up an amazing staircase that I neglected to photograph, and that I can&rsquo;t find referenced online). There we rested in the museum caf&eacute; overlooking the pyramid, and then proceeded on to the apartments &#8211; which were easily the gaudiest rooms I have ever set foot in at any point in my life, but which were fascinating to experience first-hand.</p>
<p>Exiting the Napoleon III Apartments, we found an area of the museum dedicated to works that represented the revolutionary period in France. Here I did my French teachers proud (and had more success with the language than I would have thought possible): My goal was to see if the Louvre held one of the metric clocks from the revolutionary era. Metric time was only briefly used in any form at the beginning of the Republic, and its most common application was in the calendar. Very few metric clocks were produced at all &#8211; though a few examples survive, with dials showing the face divided into ten <span class="dropnote">hours</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>, those divided into 100 
<script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;minutes d&eacute;cimales&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;decimal minutes&#8221;");</script>, and those in turn divided into <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "&laquo;secondes d&eacute;cimales&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&#8220;decimal seconds&#8221;");</script>. Most of these are superimposed on a standard clock face showing twenty-four hours around the perimeter (because the metric clock made only one revolution per day, rather than the two revolutions that are made by a twelve-hour clock). Anyway, the guard did not speak English, and did not understand what I was talking about when I asked if there were an <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "horloge m&eacute;trique");LangBoxJ("EN", "metric clock");</script> 
in the Louvre. So I had to go through the more detailed explanation, pretty much as I laid it out for you above. The fact that I was able to do so was a high point of my trip.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know why the disconnect in nomenclature &#8211; or, for that matter, the disconnect in logic, as the minute and second divisions are centimal, not decimal.</td>

<p>Anyway, the upshot of the story is that, unfortunately, the Louvre does not have one of these timepieces on display. But, since a group of clock faces were among my first experiments when I was learning to use Macromedia Flash last year, I will not deny you what the Louvre denied me:</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll allow me to digress and rant for a bit (and frankly, you wouldn&rsquo;t have made it this far if either of those were a problem): This is one of the reasons that the metric system bugs me. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I try to use it in tandem with the U.S. system just to keep my mind nimble, and I can even understand the temperature in Celsius as well as Fahrenheit without a calculator. But at the end of the day, the metric system is built on a shaky foundation. And, while it is nonetheless brilliant in concept, people on the street don&rsquo;t really comprehend its brilliance.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take those in reverse order: If you&rsquo;re standing at the Eiffel Tower and you ask how far away the Gare du nord is, you&rsquo;ll be told by the knowledgeable person that it is about 6 km away. But if you respond, &#8220;How far is that in hectometers? Or decameters?,&#8221; you&rsquo;ll be met with a blank stare. The answers, of course, are 60 hm and 600 dam, respectively &#8211; but average people are just as challenged with the conversion from kilometers to centimeters as we are with a conversion from miles to inches. The fact that you can do it in your head if you know what the prefixes mean has absolutely no relevance when most of the people in the metric world <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know what the prefixes mean.</p>
<p>And they also don&rsquo;t know what the distances mean: It became a running joke when Mom, Billy, and I were in Italy, that every time we asked directions, the destination was invariably 50 meters away. Actual distances ranged from about ten meters to (more commonly) several hundred, but in much of the metric world (and Italy is not the only example, just the first that we encountered) &#8220;50 meters&#8221; means &#8220;a ways up.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the more controversial of my assertions is that the metric system is built on a shaky foundation. Maybe you&rsquo;ll think that I can&rsquo;t defend that point &#8211; but at least let me try by drawing your attention to that foundation. For every unit of measure, the base unit can be preceded by one from a set of prefixes that establish the multiplier of that unit:</p>

<p>For the first three levels adjacent to the base unit (shaded above), the multipliers advance by a factor of ten. But thereafter, they advance by a factor of 1,000. This helps streamline things when the base unit (a byte, for example) is woefully out of scope with the practical application of that unit (a 300 GB hard drive, for example). But a little more finesse near the base units would make sense, in my opinion. And metric time is a perfect example of why: Let&rsquo;s assume that the base unit of time is the &#8220;day&#8221;: If so, then decimal minutes are &#8220;centidays.&#8221; But there is no single word that reflects the measurement indicated by a decimal second; rather, it would either be 1/10 of a &#8220;milliday&#8221; or 100 &#8220;microdays.&#8221;
	The inverse is true as well:  If the base unit is the &#8220;decimal second,&#8221; then decimal minutes are &#8220;hectoseconds,&#8221; but hours are 10 &#8220;kiloseconds,&#8221; lacking a word of their own. The only way it would work for both organization and casual reference would be if the decimal minute were the base unit (second = &#8220;centiminutes&#8221;; hours = &#8220;hectominutes&#8221;) &#8211; but the framework of the metric system, that base units should have some natural practicality, is violated in such a schema; really the base unit should be the day, as that is based on observable phenomena directly related to the planet earth (although in modern science it&rsquo;s actually the second).</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the metric system is <i>pretty</i> cool, and I think it&rsquo;s <i>better</i> than our system. But, at the end of the day, it leaves room for improvement.</p>
<p>But, okay, back on track: We were both tired and ready to get back to the apartment at this point, so Mom and I went downstairs and exited the Louvre near the covered expanse that is the <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cour Marly");LangBoxJ("EN", "Marly Courtyard");</script> and <script>LangBoxJ("FR", "Cour Puget");LangBoxJ("EN", "Puget Courtyard");</script>. These are elaborate sculpture gardens, set in the trapezoidal space that fucks up the Louvre&rsquo;s orientation on Paris&rsquo;s backbone, the &#8220;Historical Axis.&#8221; There&rsquo;ll be more about this in tomorrow&rsquo;s report, but remember that this is the point in space that&rsquo;s responsible for it.</p>

<p>Mom and I tried to go see the hourly light show at the Eiffel Tower, but, for some reason, it didn&rsquo;t start when it was supposed to. And to add insult to injury, it started to rain as we were standing out in the Champs de Mars waiting.</p>
<p>So what do you do when you&rsquo;re staying in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, and have the opportunity to see it, and photograph it, from new and beautiful vantage points every single day?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is: You do so. But what do you do with those pictures in the trip report, when they don&rsquo;t fit the narrative at all &#8211;but, rather, are just a photo of something you passed on the way to something else? Unless I come up with a better idea, I&rsquo;m going to put them in a section of Eiffel Tower pictures (of which this is an example) at the bottom of each day&rsquo;s report.</p>
