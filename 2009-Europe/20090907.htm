<p>I was really psyched that our Aer Lingus flight departed from Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), as this was a rare opportunity to set foot in the historic terminal. People who view airports as a necessary inconvenience <i>detest</i> Terminal 1, because its daring design (by architect Paul Andreu) didn&rsquo;t really usher in the design of the future as hoped.</p>
<p>But my appreciation for airports extends beyond their utilitiarian service as a transportation conduit: Indeed, I revel in infrastructure and architecture, and Terminal 1 had both in spades:  The central component was designed as a multi-story doughnut, with escalators connecting the levels across the central void. Planes land at seven pods that surround the terminal, which are accessed via sinewy underground moving sidewalks at the departure areas. Logistically, it is not a smashing success: Each pod can accommodate only five aircraft (so a total of 35 at any given time), and the layout, meant to reduce walking distances, has always caused confusion. Finally, the design was so resistant to expansion that, when more gates were needed, they simply had to build another unconnected terminal next door.</p>
<p>Even so, I remember reading about this terminal when I was a kid, and it was a thrill to set foot in what the people of 1974 thought the future would look like.</p>

	<p>That was the callsign for our flight: &ldquo;Shamrock 521.&rdquo; Most airline callsigns are pretty boring: Delta is &ldquo;<b>Delta</b>&rdquo;; Northwest is &ldquo;<b>Northwest</b>&rdquo;; KLM is &ldquo;<b>KLM</b>&rdquo;; Air France is &ldquo;<b>Air France</b>&rdquo; (to run down the list of the other flights/ticketing agents we used on this trip). I suppose that&rsquo;s fair: When you&rsquo;re talking about getting something that&rsquo;s full of human beings, and weighs 200,000 kg, safely from 10,000 m down to 0, you don&rsquo;t really want to imagine the people in the control booth saying, &ldquo;Hey, you know what would be fun; let&rsquo;s make up some crazy names for the airlines!&rdquo; But for various historical reasons, a few of the airlines did end up with crazy names: AirTran is &ldquo;<b>Citrus</b>&rdquo;; US Airways is &ldquo;<b>Cactus</b>&rdquo;; and, as we learned for this flight, Aer Lingus is &ldquo;<b>Shamrock</b>.&rdquo; </p>
	<p>I really wanted to make fun of Aer Lingus, &rsquo;cause their name sounds kinda silly, and they&rsquo;re developing a reputation as one of the European cheap-fare-but-every-single-thing-is-extra airlines. But they were actually pretty good. They gave us soft drinks (no extra charge) and seemed genuinely committed to helping. (A woman at the counter in Paris took quite a while trying to figure out how to refund our advance payment for a second checked bag when we showed up with only one suitcase.)</p>
	<p>And you can&rsquo;t beat this: Our flight was free! When I did my research in Kayak, I got a fare quote of $115 for each ticket (which I thought was a pretty good deal). But when I clicked through to the Aer Lingus website, it gave me a promotional fare with a base price of &euro;&nbsp;0. After taxes and fees were added in, it came back up to <script>MeasurementBoxJ("EUR", "&euro;&nbsp;65.34", true);MeasurementBoxJ("USD", "$94.69", false);</script> each, but that included our baggage fees, which I was going to have to add to the Kayak rate anyway, so definitely I had no complaints. The ticket was weird, though: It wasn&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> electronic, but it wasn&rsquo;t quite <i>paper</i> either &ndash; after booking, they sent me an e-mail with the instruction that I had to print it and bring it; otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to board. Period. </p>
	<p>Their name <i>is</i> kinda silly, though. It&rsquo;s not even real Irish; rather, it&rsquo;s an anglicization  of the Irish term, <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "aerloingeas"); LangBoxJ("EN", "air fleet");</script>.</p>
<p>But I would eagerly fly them again. Aside from all of the other virtues I&rsquo;ve mentioned, they left Paris on time, and got us in early to DUB &ndash; <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Dublin Airport"); LangBoxJ("GA", "Aerfort Bhaile Átha Cliath");</script> in <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "County Fingal");LangBoxJ("GA", "Contae Fhine Gall");</script>, just north of Dublin. And I found something at Dublin Airport that I would never have expected to see at any border point in the European Union: an attractive stamp in my passport. I would have been less surprised to see a leprechaun. </p>
<p>County Fingal was known to the Vikings as <script>LangBoxJ("NON", "&laquo;Dyflinarskiri&raquo;");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;the hinterland of Dublin&rdquo;");</script>, but no one would say that about it now. And as the site of the busiest airport in Ireland, I found County Fingal&rsquo;s motto anachronistically amusing: <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "Flúirse Talaimh is Mara");LangBoxJ("EN", "Abundance of Land and Sea");</script>.</p>

<p>You may notice that this section, unlike those for the Netherlands and France, lacks a long name for the country. This is because there is no long name for Ireland. The Irish constitution specifies that <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;");LangBoxJ("GA", "&ldquo;Poblacht na hÉireann&rdquo;");</script> is the official <i>description</i> of the country &ndash; but emphasizes that its name is only <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;");</script> in English and <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "&ldquo;Éire&rdquo;");</script> &ndash; <span class="dropnote">with an accent</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> &ndash; in Irish. And they get pretty serious about it: In 1989, the Irish Supreme Court ruled that British extradition warrants must henceforth, if written in English, use the name &ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Republic of Ireland,&rdquo; explicitly commanding that, &ldquo;they are not at liberty to attribute to this State a name which is not its correct name.&rdquo;</p>

					<td>This accent gives us a window to the unique psychological perspective of diplomats. The same Irish constitution that specified so carefully the name of the country also contained a claim to the &ldquo;whole island of Ireland.&rdquo; Wishing to contain the can of worms that would be opened either with a direct challenge to that claim, or with a concession to it, the British government in the mid-1900s had an official policy of referring to the nation as &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; (intentionally without the accent), thus attempting to sidestep recognition, by name, of a government that was challenging its own claim to Northern Ireland.</td>

	<p>But beyond simple facts about Ireland, I&rsquo;ve really struggled with this section. The truth of the matter is, I don&rsquo;t have a handle on Ireland: Even with Irish ancestry on my mother&rsquo;s side, I experience the country as a tourist rather than as a heritage, and I struggle with the juxtaposition of Ireland&rsquo;s damaged history with its industrious present.</p>
	<p>It is clear that the Irish people still feel the wounds of their history. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many awkward conversations I&rsquo;ve had in which Irish people have elided mention of the Great Famine and its incredible drain on the Irish population (not only through death but also through emigration) along the lines of the following: &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re from America ... <i>(pause)</i> ... We had some family who moved to America ... <i>(pause)</i> ... quite a while ago ... <i>(pause)</i> ... <i>(suddenly brightly)</i> I hope you&rsquo;re enjoying your time in Ireland!&rdquo; Similar conversations seemed to dodge the subjects of British rule over Ireland, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The feeling was not so much they would consider it impolite for me to wonder about their past, as that they would feel impolite sharing it. But it&rsquo;s not just their <i>past</i> that they don&rsquo;t talk about, it&rsquo;s also their <i>present</i>: Ireland is an absolute powerhouse, but because they don&rsquo;t brag any more than they complain, I didn&rsquo;t know any of the following facts until I got home:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Ireland is <b>#6</b> in <b>Gross Domestic Product Per Capita</b><br />
        <i>(behind Luxembourg, Norway, Qatar, Switzerland, and Denmark; the U.S. is #13)</i></li>
      <li>Ireland is <b>#5</b> in the <b>Human Development Index</b><br />
        <i>(behind Norway, Australia, Iceland, and Canada; the U.S. is #13)</i></li>
      <li>Ireland is <b>#1</b> in the <b>Quality of Life Index</b><br />
        <i>(the U.S. is #13)</i></li>
      <li>Ireland is <b>#12</b> on the <b>Global Peace Index</b><br />
        <i>(behind Hong Kong, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Austria, Sweden, Japan, Canada, Finland, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic; the U.S. is #83)</i></li>
      <li>Ireland is <b>#5</b> from the bottom (where you want to be) on the <b>Failed States Index</b>, and is one of only 13 nations in the best category, &ldquo;Sustainable&rdquo;<br />
        <i>(behind Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland; the U.S. is #19 from the bottom, in the &ldquo;Moderate&rdquo; category)</i></li>
</ul>
    <p>But the already interesting fact, that Ireland is doing exceedingly well for itself, becomes quite a bit more engaging in light of Ireland&rsquo;s challenges. The Great Famine, known in Irish as either <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "an Gorta Mór");LangBoxJ("EN", "the Great Hunger");</script> or <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "an Drochshaol");LangBoxJ("EN", "the Bad Life");</script>, was an event of such portent in Irish history that it is now inconceivable to look at the Irish timeline except as &ldquo;pre-famine&rdquo; and &ldquo;post-famine.&rdquo; Lest you think the effect on Ireland of this potato blight, in the years 1845-1852, is overstated, here&rsquo;s a chart of the island&rsquo;s population:</p>
	<table class="PictureFrameNoWidth" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
		<tr>
			<td class="CountryBox"><img src="20090907/IrelandPopulation.jpg" /></td>

	</table>
    <p>The problems didn&rsquo;t arise in isolation, however: Ireland was described in 1844 by Benjamin Disraeli as having &ldquo;a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, and an alien Church, and in addition the weakest executive in the world.&rdquo; The Irish were more-or-less a slave class to British absentee landlords, and it was observed by the Earl of Devon in 1845 that, &ldquo;It would be impossible adequately to describe the privations which they habitually and silently endure . . . in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage water . . . their cabins are seldom a protection against the weather... a bed or a blanket is a rare luxury . . . and nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property.&rdquo; The absentee landlord system resulted in Irish workers having landholdings so small that only potatoes would suffice as a crop with which to feed their families (everything else requiring more room for even survival rations), and their renter status on these lands (along with a system in which renters were frequently and capriciously turned out) served as a disincentive to improvement. The stage was set for disaster when the potato blight hit.</p>
    <p>John Mitchell wrote in his work, <i>The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)</i>, that, &ldquo;The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine.&rdquo; Yet, to add insult to injury, the absentee landlords kept the food flowing across the Irish Sea: Even as the Irish were quite literally starving to death, net exports to Britain <i>increased</i> during the famine years. Jane Francesca Elgee penned the following:</p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center"><tr><td>
<i>Weary men, what reap ye? Golden corn for the stranger.<br />
What sow ye? Human corpses that wait for the avenger.<br />
Fainting forms, Hunger-stricken, what see you in the offing<br />
Stately ships to bear our food away, amid the stranger&rsquo;s scoffing.<br />
There&rsquo;s a proud array of soldiers &ndash; what do they round your door?<br />
They guard our master&rsquo;s granaries from the thin hands of the poor.<br />
Pale mothers, wherefore weeping? &rsquo;Would to God that we were dead &ndash;<br />
Our children swoon before us, and we cannot give them bread.</i>

    <p>The best that can be said of the British crown&rsquo;s response is that it did little-to-nothing: <span class="dropnote">Queen Victoria</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> donated only £2,000 of her own money.</p>
    <p>If the queen had stopped at &ldquo;little-to-nothing,&rdquo; more Irish children might have lived. But when the Ottoman sultan Abdülmecid I tried to donate £10,000 to famine relief, the queen requested that he lower the donation to £1,000, so as not to overshadow her own smaller donation. He acquiesced, but it didn&rsquo;t stop there: When he sent three ships full of food, England tried to block the delivery.</p>

					<td>As you may have heard, only the good die young. Victoria dragged on until she was 81, having served England (and destroyed Ireland) as the longest-reigning monarch in its history. The British had a terrible habit of scraping their knives across maps to set up boundaries that left the world with lingering contention, because the Britons neither knew nor cared about the people under their collective thumb. By coincidence, they had especially bad luck with countries starting with <span class="PictureCaptionRoman">I</span> (witness, Ireland, India, and Israel). But the former of these was their most vexing misstep. Karma was no stranger to the British, but it was a treacherous bedfellow after the Irish debacle. Queen Victoria was reviled on the island until at least the day she gasped her last clutching breath. When she visited Ireland in 1900, opposition to her remained fierce, and an organization was founded to channel this outrage &#8211; <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "Cumann na nGaedhael");LangBoxJ("EN", "Society of the Gaels");</script>
					. It eventually was reconstituted under another name that the British won&rsquo;t soon forget:

    <p>Another donation to famine relief came from the Choctaw Tribe in the U.S.: Because of its own bitter memories of starvation and privation on the Trail of Tears just sixteen years previous, the impoverished Choctaw raised $710 to send to famine relief in Ireland. The gesture was so meaningful to the Irish people that nearly a century-and-a-half later, when the Choctaw marked the 150th anniversary of the Trail of Tears, a contingent came from Ireland to join them in the commemorative journey. </p>
    <p>And this is fairly recent history: It&rsquo;s only slightly more distant than the U.S. Civil War (and we&rsquo;re still fighting that!). Even so, it is not the Ireland that the Irish people show you. The Ireland you see today is gleaming cities, busy sea- and airports, fertile fields, new roads, and an active, engaged, smart populace. It would be a shining example of possibility even if the famine had never happened. But since we do know this history, Ireland of today is the biggest testament to human potential that I think I will ever see. </p>

<p>But, mind you, I have no complaints about resurrecting a language. Indeed, Hebrew was completely dead as a spoken language until the late 1800s &ndash; but as we learned on our last vacation, a dead language can make quite a comeback! I find Irish challenging and impenetrable (and, as you&rsquo;ll see anon, I can go on and on about the difficulties I have with the language), but culturally it is a touchstone for Ireland, and I wish them the best in its revival. Although I doubt that I&rsquo;ll ever study Irish, I hope that on my next visit to Ireland, those percentages above are much higher. And I&rsquo;m sure they will be: Another article that I read stated that 89% of Irish schoolchildren had studied Irish as their second language, and stated also that Ireland is preparing to institute Irish-language education (i.e., the whole curriculum in Irish) in some of its grade schools. </p>
<p>There is a reason, by the way, that I refer to the language as &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Gaelic&rdquo;: Because this is what the Irish do. To them, &ldquo;Gaelic&rdquo; (when speaking English) is a term referring to either of their two major national sports: hurling and Gaelic football. (But I didn&rsquo;t know this when I started working on the trip report, so if you look at the underlying JavaScript programming that makes a lot of the interactive stuff work &ndash; including the Irish Pronunciation Utility at the top of this page &ndash; you&rsquo;ll find a lot of variables with the word &ldquo;Gaelic&rdquo; as part of the name.)</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s just coming off life support, Irish is doing infinitely better than 
  <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Yola");LangBoxJ("YOL", "Yola");</script>, a language particular to Ireland&rsquo;s County Wexford, having split from English in the twelfth century. Yola (the name means &ldquo;old&rdquo; in that language) was not just gone, <span class="dropnote">but pretty much forgotten</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. Yola remained largely mutually intelligible with English &ndash; until it ceased to remain at all. Following is what may have been the last public address in Yola, delivered to Earl Musgrave, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in 1836 (and fraught with subtext if I take its flowery translation correctly). Notice how closely the language tracks English. (To make the noticing easier, I&rsquo;ve put in some scripting so you can hover the mouse over any word and see it &ndash; and the surrounding sentence &ndash; highlighted in both languages. But do be aware that this works more reliably in Firefox than in other browsers that I&rsquo;ve tested.) </p>

		<p>Okay, here I&rsquo;m just being playful: The word &ldquo;eolotthowghrhoighuay&rdquo; &ndash; coined by Alexander Ellis in 1845 to illustrate spelling irregularities in English &ndash; would be pronounced like &ldquo;orthography&rdquo; if you took the (atypical) pronunciations of the letter combinations in the following words:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>G<span class="orthography">eo</span>rge co<span class="orthography">lo</span>nel Ma<span class="orthography">tth</span>ew kn<span class="orthography">ow</span>ledge <span class="orthography">gh</span>ost <span class="orthography">rh</span>eumatic Beauv<span class="orthography">oi</span>r lau<span class="orthography">gh</span> q<span class="orthography">uay</span></b></p>
		<p>It serves as an illustrative companion to the more recent (1855, by William Ollier) &ndash; and better known &ndash; example of spelling &ldquo;fish&rdquo; as &ldquo;ghoti,&rdquo; based on: </p>
		<p align="center"><b>tou<span class="orthography">gh</span> w<span class="orthography">o</span>men na<span class="orthography">ti</span>on</b></p>
		<p>So, as much as I&rsquo;m about to complain about the Irish language below, I&rsquo;ll be quick to acknowledge that English doesn&rsquo;t hold the high ground on this topic. </p>

							  This word is a special reminder of John: A couple of weeks before the trip, he had taken me on a field trip to the Museum of the Alphabet in Waxhaw, North Carolina, which showcases the evolution of writing systems as well as the strategies for applying systems of writing to formerly unwritten languages.  (It might be said that he took me kicking and screaming on this trip &ndash; but he was right: I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it is now a cherished memory of time with him.) <br />
								<br />
								As we discussed our shared fascination with language and writing on that journey, conversation wandered to the &ldquo;ghoti&rdquo; example, which we were both familiar with.<br />
								<br />
								I mentioned that I had recently seen a longer and more interesting example of this technique, in which the word &ldquo;orthography&rdquo; was written in a spelling-irregular fashion, but couldn&rsquo;t remember the details. This intrigued John, and I promised to e-mail that example to him after getting home, as soon as I remembered. <br />

		<p> But still, I&rsquo;m not completely without cause for complaint about Irish <span style="text-decoration:line-through; color:#888">eolotthowghrhoighuay</span> orthography: My first point is that, to the untrained eye, &ldquo;Eolotthowghrhoighuay&rdquo; looks like it <i>could</i> be an Irish word, which emphasizes my second point: Irish is absurdly difficult to spell. You may recall – if you immerse yourself in my trip reports with doggedness of a 15-year-old and the driver&rsquo;s manual (as, I must acknowledge, perhaps you don&rsquo;t) – we were tripped up in various contexts in the first trip to Ireland by an utter inability to look at Irish text without having our eyes instantly glaze over. And on the day of our escape from Dublin, when snows canceled our ferry back to Britain and we were informed <span class="dropnote">blah&nbsp;blah&nbsp;whine&nbsp;whine</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>, I wasted precious seconds asking directions to what I thought was pronounced <script>LangBoxJ("IPA", "/dʌn ˈleɪoʊgæɹ/");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;dun layogehr&rdquo;");</script> (because it was spelled &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire&rdquo;), but was actually pronounced <script>LangBoxJ("IPA", "/dʊn ˈliːriː/");LangBoxJ("EN", "&ldquo;dun leery&rdquo;");</script>.  I thus had the thought: &ldquo;Perhaps I should learn to pronounce Irish, so the word forms will at least make sense to me, and I will at least be able to ask directions without making time-consuming errors.&rdquo; </p>

			<br />
			By providence, we did &ndash; with two minutes to spare. If we&rsquo;d hit one more red light, who knows? Or &ndash; and this preys on my mind to this day &ndash; if my mispronunciation of Dun Laoghaire had caused any confusion?</td>

		<p>So, as one does, I turned to Wikipedia to ascertain how the letters in Irish are turned into sounds, and this is what lay before me (actually, believe it or not, a slightly more complicated version of this is what lay before me):</p>
		<blockquote>
		<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="IRISH/GaelicWikipedia.htm"></iframe>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So if you scrutinize that guide (which, let&rsquo;s be frank, you didn&rsquo;t), you&rsquo;ll see that there is an internal consistency in saying that <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "&ldquo;Dun Laoghaire&rdquo;");</script> is <span class="dropnote">pronounced &ldquo;dun leery.&rdquo;</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> Still, I assume the phrase, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s spelled like it sounds,&rdquo; has never been used in relation to Irish without irony. And wrap your mind around this: As complicated as it seems now, this version is what Irish looks like <i>after</i> simplification came by way of a spelling reform in the middle of the 20th century.</p>

		<p>Still, I had not (yet) given up in my mission to learn to pronounce it ... </p>
		<p>If I want to learn a system, my standard approach is to break it down to the components that will allow me to write a flow chart or a computer program or whatever that can achieve the same goal. And this is what I did with Irish orthography. First, I simplified the structure by removing things that: </p>
		<ol>
		  <li>I considered too complex to bother with (such as stressed vs. unstressed syllables),</li>
		  <li>I didn&rsquo;t have the background to include (such as alternate pronunciations in verb forms), and</li>
		  <li>I basically considered bullshit (such as an IPA diacritic that presents itself in some contexts of <span class="dropnote">lenition</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> but which causes all sorts of font mapping issues).</li>
	  </ol>
<table class="dropnoteframe">
	<tr>
		<th width="25%">&nbsp;</th>
		<td width="75%">
			<table class="dropnotetable">
				<tr>
					<th>➴</th>
					<td>And really, why do words like &ldquo;lenition&rdquo; and &ldquo;eclipsis&rdquo; keep coming up in this project? Is Irish really this hard, or is it just the pet project of a small (and possibly uncooperative) cabal of obsessive scholars? If you read enough about it, you&rsquo;ll be informed that all of the extra letters allude to the movement of the tongue as the word is being formed, but that these subtleties can only be heard by native speakers (and, perhaps, bats).</td>

</table>
		<p>So, armed with my simplified approach, I wrote me some JavaScript. And I got to play with regular expressions, which I&rsquo;ve used before, but which are about the coolest thing you can do in a computer program. The JavaScript code is below (actually a beta version of it; use View &gt; Source for the real thing); with regular expressions <span class="RegExp">shaded in olive</span>. Basically a regular expression is framed in slash marks, and uses some clever punctuation to match patterns in text: </p>
		<blockquote>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">
					<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="IRISH/GaelicJavaScript.htm"></iframe>					</td>
				<td width="3%">&nbsp;</td>
				<td width="47%">
				  <p>A question mark makes content optional<br />
					  <span class="RegExpCode">/colou?r/</span> finds both the British and American spelling (&ldquo;colour&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;color&rdquo;). <br />
					  <br />
					  Brackets frame choices:<br />
					<span class="RegExpCode">/latin[ao]/</span> finds both the feminine and masculine versions (&ldquo;latina&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;latino&rdquo;). <br />
					<br />
					Parentheses enclose sets; pipes separate alternatives:<br />
					<span class="RegExpCode">/United (Arab Emirates|Kingdom|States of America)/</span> finds all three countries.<br />
					<br />
					The &ldquo;lookaround&rdquo; feature permits matches based on the following text:<br />
					<span class="RegExpCode">/John(?= Smith)/</span> finds the &ldquo;John&rdquo; in &ldquo;John Smith,&rdquo; but not the &ldquo;John&rdquo; in &ldquo;John Jones.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>So if I&rsquo;m told that &ldquo;ui&rdquo; makes a certain sound only when it&rsquo;s followed by &ldquo;cht,&rdquo; &ldquo;rs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rt,&rdquo; I can zoom in on that phoneme with ease using a regular expression:<br />
				  <span class="RegExpCode">/ui(?=(cht|r[st]))/</span></p>
			  <p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s the gist of it, but there&rsquo;s a <i>lot</i> more: wildcards, minimum and maximum number of pattern repetitions, position of the search term in the original, whether the search finds the first occurrence or all occurrences, case sensitivity, whether the search is &ldquo;greedy&rdquo; (finds the broadest possibly match) or &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; (finds the narrowest), and a &ldquo;lookbehind&rdquo; feature that works similarly to the &ldquo;lookaround&rdquo; feature described above (and which would have been <i>freakin&rsquo; awesome</i> in this project, except that it hasn&rsquo;t yet been implemented in JavaScript).</p></td>

	  <p>So I put together the algorithm above to display the IPA and &ldquo;English-approximate&rdquo; pronunciations of Irish words. You can test my efforts at the top of this page (and all pages in the Ireland section). You can also click on any of the green words to see the pronunciation; try it 
	    <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "here");LangBoxJ("GA", "anseo");</script>; then click on &ldquo;Return to Where You Were&rdquo; to come back to this paragraph after you see what I&rsquo;m talking about. (By the way, sometimes you&rsquo;ll see an IPA box next to an Irish word (such as beside &ldquo;Ogham&rdquo; in the next section); in these cases, the IPA information is accurate and trustworthy, while the JavaScript routine may reflect the flaws that come with standardization and simplification.)</p>

		<p>But I didn&rsquo;t leave you with just pronunciation ...</p>
		<p>If you read through the JavaScript code (which, again, let&rsquo;s be frank, you didn&rsquo;t) you noticed that it goes off on a tangent &ndash; two tangents, actually, the first of which is <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Ogham");LangBoxJ("GA", "Ogham");LangBoxJ("IPA", "/oːmˠ/");</script>.
		This is the old style of writing the Irish language, appearing originally on the edges of boulders (starting at the bottom so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about scrunching up if you run out of space), and presumably on tree branches (although none of those survive). Additionally, a small amount of written material in Ogham has been preserved.</p>
		<p>In the Irish sections of this trip report, I am including (where appropriate) a box such as the one at left to show the Ogham representation of the topic or city; you can hover your mouse over the individual letters to see what they are (but do keep in mind that when Ogham is written vertically, it is written from bottom to top; otherwise it won&rsquo;t make any sense). </p>
		<p>When I first heard of Ogham, I thought of it as the pure way of writing Irish, before the British showed up with their Protestantism and crumpets and silent letters. I further thought, since it was written by carving on rocks, that surely it demonstrated more of an economy of content than the modern version. But this seems not to be the case. Except for a handful of two-letter forms (only one of which &ndash; <nobr><img src="IRISH/OGHAM_FEATHER1.PNG" style="height:0.75em" /><img src="IRISH/OGHAM_AE.PNG" style="height:0.75em" /><img src="IRISH/OGHAM_FEATHER2.PNG" style="height:0.75em" /></nobr> or <i>AE</i> &ndash; is used regularly) Ogham seems to have (more or less) a one-to-one correlation to the Latin alphabet (omitting, of course, letters that are not used in Irish). And in fact, these two-letter forms generally involve more complex strokes (and consequently more hours of scraping at the rock) than the individual letters they replace.</p>
		<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a beautiful style of writing with its elegant simplicity. </p>
		<p>The term &ldquo;Ogham,&rdquo; by the way, refers to the style of writing, not to the characters themselves. The characters, rather, are referred to as the <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "Beith-luis-nin");</script>, after the first and second letters of the alphabet. (The word &ldquo;nin&rdquo; may be a variant of the name of the fifth letter, or a generic term for the word &ldquo;letters&rdquo;; scholars are still debating this point.) The Beith-luis-nin is divided into <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "aicmí");LangBoxJ("EN", "families");</script> (singular is <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "aicme");</script>&nbsp;); the first four are named after the first letter in the group; the last is known as the <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "Forfeda");LangBoxJ("EN", "supplementary letters");</script>. Anyway, here it is, with the Latin correlations in black and the Irish names of the letters in green:</p>

	You&rsquo;ll notice the Ogham date, by the way, at the top of the page. I think it&rsquo;s cool, and I&rsquo;m glad I included it as a page element, but don&rsquo;t put too much stock in it. References to an Ogham calendar are a dime a dozen online; references that correlate with each other are more precious than gold. Apparently, some kind of calendar was kept in antiquity, written in Ogham &ndash; but references are sketchy, and the concept has been appropriated by various neo-Pagan movements, not all (or, as far as I can tell, any) of which have considered historical accuracy to be an essential element of the calendar&rsquo;s use. Generally, it seems that the Ogham calendar begins at the full moon nearest Samhain (although some references say Yule), and then increments through a series of tree and plant names, each of which has an associated letter in the Beith-luis-nin.<br />

	<p>The cycle within which our trip fell began (probably) with the full moon of November 13, 2008. We arrived in Ireland ten full moons, plus four days, after that date; thus, our month was &ldquo;ivy,&rdquo; represented by the letter Gort &ndash; <nobr><img src="IRISH/OGHAM_FEATHER1.PNG" style="height:0.75em" /><img src="IRISH/OGHAM_G.PNG" style="height:0.75em" /><img src="IRISH/OGHAM_FEATHER2.PNG" style="height:0.75em" /></nobr> or <i>G</i>. But actually writing &ldquo;the fourth of ivy&rdquo; or anything similar, turned out to be a vexing project: For a writing system based on tally marks, it seems that a counting system would be an established and integral component, but my investigation of this issue came to several dead ends. My friend Randy helped me out with this and found some indication that Ogham wrote its numbers in Ogham representations of Roman Numerals. This strikes me as absurd, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any other information, so I went with it. Thus, the date at the top of the page, also shown to the left here, transliterates, quite simply, as &ldquo;G IU&rdquo; (<i>U</i> = <i>V</i>, so &ldquo;IU&rdquo; = 4). </p>

		  <p>The other tangent the JavaScript went off on was <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Irish Sign Language");LangBoxJ("GA", "Teanga Chomharthaíochta na hÉireann");</script>. ISL didn&rsquo;t actually come up on our most recent trip, but it&rsquo;s a fascinating subject for me, and one that I encountered briefly on our previous trip to Ireland, so I hope you&rsquo;ll indulge my digression. And, if you&rsquo;re going by the numbers, ISL has 40,000 daily users, which, as a minority language in Ireland, compares at 0.9% quite favorably with the Irish language&rsquo;s 1.3%. </p>
			<p>Sign Language is a disintuitive overlay to spoken languages. The American system was heavily influenced by the French, while the British system evolved independently &ndash; arising earlier by a couple of centuries, but having been so suppressed by the oralist sentiment (i.e., the belief that deaf education should rely exclusively on speech and lipreading) that it was unavailable as a peer resource at the time that deaf education was becoming established in the United States. (That and the fact that we had just finished fighting the War of 1812 with them, and probably weren&rsquo;t going to run over for educational advice anyway.) Therefore, we are left with this odd scenario:</p>

					<li>Hearing Americans must study an array of languages (French, German, Dutch, Flemish, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian) to communicate easily in Western Europe, while deaf Americans find American Sign Language mutually intelligible with the sign languages used in most of those areas (not identical, but similar enough to carry on a conversation without specific training).</li>
					  <li>By contrast, a hearing American can navigate the United Kingdom quite easily, with only a few areas of confusion between the two varieties of spoken English &ndash; but deaf Americans and deaf Britons cannot communicate at all except by writing (unless, of course, they have gone to the unusual step of learning a second sign language). </li>

			<p>Because of their proximity, shared history, and other similarities (not to mention the habit the British have of imposing their ways on anybody who can&rsquo;t outgun their navy), I had assumed that the deaf community in Ireland would communicate using a variant of the British system, rather than the French system (of which American Sign Language is a branch).</p>

	<p>I love driving on the left; there&rsquo;s just something interesting and unique about it. And I think I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at it.</p>
	<p>This was my second experience, the first being on the driving tour that Billy and I took in the U.K and Ireland in 2002.  I remember that by the end of that trip, I was immeasurably more comfortable driving on the left than at the start &ndash; but there were a few things I never completely mastered that time, which I finally got a handle on this time:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>In 2002, I never got where I could look in the rear-view mirror and get any sense of the road behind me that was comparable to what I would get in the same situation driving at home.<br />
	    <i>This time I made a concerted effort to conceptualize the rear view, and got quite comfortable driving without turning my head around at every lane change.</i> </li>
	  <li>In 2002, I never backed out of a parking space onto the proper side of the road (never a problem, because I was always careful that nothing was coming in <i>either</i> direction, but a mental annoyance nonetheless).<br />
	    <i>This is harder than it seems; I made the same mistake a few times, but on this trip I tried to get a handle on my mental confusion and eventually got where I did it successfully. </i></li>
	  <li>In 2002, I rarely walked to the correct side of the vehicle.<br />
	  <i>This time, I walked pretty reliably to the door on the right. And I even got so comfortable with it that I walked once to the wrong side of an American car about a week after we got home. </i></li>
	  <li>In 2002, I learned how to adjust my perceptions to center the car in the lane, but I never really felt like this was as effortless as it was back home (nor as effortless as it should be).<br />
	    <i>I put a lot of thought into this issue after the 2002 trip, and had an insight that I wasn&rsquo;t able to test until this return to Ireland: I don&rsquo;t know if </i>everybody<i> does this, but </i>I<i> center the car in the lane by looking diagonally across the hood at the curb (i.e., in America, I look from the driver&rsquo;s seat on the left across to the right-front corner of the car, and then to the lane marking). I speculated that I had continued looking at the right-front corner of the car, but because I was already sitting on the right side of the car, that this caused my centering frustration. My theory was correct: Looking from my seat on the right, across the &ldquo;bonnet,&rdquo; to the left-front corner by the &ldquo;kerb&rdquo; helped me position the car in the lane with ease.</i></li>
	  <li>In 2002, I kept looking to the upper-right for my rear-view mirror.<br />
	    <i>Didn&rsquo;t happen this time at all. </i></li>
	  <li>In 2002, I kept reaching in the wrong direction for the seat belt.<br />
	    <i>Still happened a lot (there&rsquo;s just something about having a steering wheel in front of me that puts me in the mind of grabbing for the seat belt over my left shoulder); but I eventually quit making this mistake.</i> </li>
	  </ul>
	<p>But Hertz seemed to be almost in a panic that I would forget which side of the road to drive on. Reminders were scattered throughout the printed materials, and there were no fewer than <i>four</i> stickers providing the same advice impeding my view through the windshield and to the controls: two on the left side of the windshield; one (reflective, so it was especially prominent at night) on the right side; and one across the speedometer. To help them out, the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "National Roads Authority");LangBoxJ("GA", "An tÚdarás urn Bóithre Náisiúnta");</script> 
	  has scattered a few such reminders around the country as well. But this raises a point in logic that occurred to me on the first trip to Ireland: These signs (and their counterparts in the U.K.) seem invariably to appear in the middle of a long rural stretch. To my mind, this type of reminder might be in place coming out of the airport (or anywhere that rental cars congregate), near major hotels (to catch people as they&rsquo;re just starting out for the day), or at major points of interest (to ensure that tourists don&rsquo;t get lax after making a pit stop). But if I&rsquo;ve been driving on, let&rsquo;s say, the N24 for an hour-and-a-half, and I&rsquo;m out in the middle of nowhere, and I&rsquo;m still at the wheel (not, let&rsquo;s say, in a ditch bleeding from the head), then this is <i>probably</i> not a mistake I&rsquo;m in the process of making. </p>
	<p>As for vehicle, I requested a subcompact (better for the wallet and for the narrow Irish roads), and Hertz gave me a Suzuki Swift (with manual transmission, of course). It was one of my favorite rental vehicles &ndash; possibly second only to the Citro&euml;n Picasso, which I still remember fondly from four years ago in Switzerland. </p>
	<p>From my American mindset, the lane markings in Ireland are a strange reversal &ndash; yellow lines rest along the edges of the road, and white is used for two conflicting purposes: (A) separating lanes going in the <i>same</i> direction, and (B) separating lanes going in <i>opposite</i> directions. There is less ambiguity than you would think because roads with more than one lane in each direction are less common than in the U.S., and, where they exist, are usually separated by a median. But cases causing confusion do indeed occur, and the system is usually to mitigate them by making the separator between lanes a bit thicker, and to use arrows abundantly. The only time I really got confused was coming out of a roundabout at night a couple of times: In the dark it wasn&rsquo;t obvious whether I had exited onto a two-lane road, or whether I was on my side of a median on a four-land road; so I just stayed to the far left until I saw which way traffic was going in the lane to my right. </p>
	<p>As I mentioned above, Irish is doing well in the signage of Ireland. I say this because (almost) every single sign in the country is written in Irish first, followed by English. They distinguish the two by writing Irish in mixed-case italics, and English in all-caps; it seems like it would be easy to differentiate once you got the hang of the system, but I constantly found my eyes landing on the first part of the sign and failing to track to the English translation until it was too late. I much prefer the Greek system, in which Greek writing is yellow and English writing is white. (And I&rsquo;m okay if they don&rsquo;t include English at all, as was frequently the case in Jordan. It&rsquo;s just that, if the English is there, I want a color-coded system to help me see it before I go shooting past the sign.)</p>
	<p>There are also those local cultural things that are hard to get used to. The most peculiar to me was the way Irish drivers used the wide curb lanes (sometimes marked as slow lanes) on the rare occasions that they existed. These lanes are almost never wide enough for a vehicle, and driving at length in them is not an option (neither legally nor practically). Slow vehicles will often (but not often enough) pull into them to let faster vehicles scoot around more easily. But a more common use is as an acceleration lane: Ireland doesn&rsquo;t have center turn lanes such as are common in America (although anecdotally, they seem to share my opinion that it&rsquo;s a brilliant system and superior to theirs); instead for making a right turn (which, remember, is a turn across <i>all</i> lanes of traffic), they will shoot across both directions of free-flowing traffic, and then nestle in the curb lane while they&rsquo;re trying to get up to speed for a merge into the main traffic lane. </p>
	<p>Finally, driving this time was made much easier by two improvements: First, Ireland has been on a road-improvement frenzy, and the quality and quantity of their intercity highways was tremendously ahead of where it had been in 2002. And on this trip we had a GPS navigation device for the first time, which helped enormously in our wayfinding. </p>
<p><img src="20090907/LogoPayzone.gif" class="PictureFloatLeft"/>One major opportunity for learning a new way of doing things was the M50 toll. The M50 is Dublin&rsquo;s perennially overcrowded orbital motorway (in American English, &ldquo;beltway&rdquo;). To reduce congestion, the toll booths were removed and an electronic system was introduced: Car plates are photographed, and payment for the passage must be completed by 8:00 PM on the day after one passes the toll section. This apparently causes a lot of confusion for visitors (and, indeed, for the residents), to the extent that Hertz warned me about it verbally and also gave me a handout.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did indeed pay my  &euro;&nbsp;3 before 8:00 PM the following day, so in theory I won&rsquo;t be receiving any nasty messages (or credit card charges) from Hertz. But on the advice of everyone I spoke to about it, I kept my receipt. Just about everyone, it seems, has a story of an M50 payment not being registered.</p>
<p>From my perspective, it worked well enough, but it certainly seems like a lot of infrastructure for a limited use. The Payzone outlets are located throughout the island, in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. I paid my toll in Caherciveen, a tiny hamlet five hours from Dublin. Overlaid on Georgia, it would be like incurring a toll in Atlanta, and paying it in Americus. </p>
<p>One failure of the GPS, however, was in finding us food. Coming off our flight, we were still on Paris time (an hour later), and were utterly famished by the time we got to the car. Then the first third of the trip was on motorways (which lacked information about local amenities, such as we rely on heavily in the U.S. when traveling in unfamiliar areas). We tried petitioning the GPS in sundry ways for guidance toward food, but it was impassive. Finally, when we found our way off the M7, we began making our way through towns, one of which had a restaurant with the best shepherd&rsquo;s pie that I think I will ever eat. Everything on the menu looked wonderful, and I found myself hoping it was a harbinger of culinary opportunity throughout Ireland. Alas, it was not. Mind you, I have no complaints at all about the food in Ireland; indeed, I was never disappointed. But even by that high standard, this place was special. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t remember its name, nor the town it was in. But while we were driving toward it we passed the Google car as it paved the way for a Google Street View overlay of Ireland. So maybe at some point I&rsquo;ll find the time to click through the roads from Dublin to Cashel, looking for (A) us and (B) this restaurant.</p>

<p>The first task of the GPS was to take us to the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Rock of Cashel");LangBoxJ("GA", "Carraig Phádraig");</script> in <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "County Tipperary");LangBoxJ("GA", "Contae Thiobraid Árann");</script>, and it passed this test (and all subsequent tests) with flying colors.</p>
<p>We drove through Ireland under moody skies, which perfectly set the stage for the Rock of Cashel; it was an ideal example of the stolid, enduring ruin that Americans come to see in Europe because it simply doesn&rsquo;t exist at home. The ruined cathedral was the seat of the King of Munster, one of the traditional four (originally five) provinces of Ireland. These original five <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "provinces");LangBoxJ("GA", "cúigí");</script> (singular is <script>LangBoxJ("GA", "cúige");</script>&nbsp;) have no official administrative function in the modern Irish government, but they have a symbolism that resonates even today: In bardic lore, they are the &ldquo;<a name="FifthsOfIreland" id="FifthsOfIreland"></a>fifths of Ireland&rdquo;:</p>

</ul>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The site  is ancient enough to have developed legends relating to <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "St. Patrick");LangBoxJ("GA", "Naomh Pádraig");</script>, running the spectrum from the possible to the fanciful: It is described as the place where the St. Patrick converted the King of Munster in the 5th Century AD. And the mount itself is described as having been formed when St. Patrick banished Satan from a cave to the north at <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Devil&rsquo;s Bit");LangBoxJ("GA", "Barnane Éile");</script>. A void in the mountain there is reminiscent of the shape of the Rock of Cashel, and the legend holds that St. Patrick caused Satan to bite a chunk from the mountain in that location, chip a tooth, and drop the Rock of Cashel where it now sits. </p>
<p>The site was sacked in 1647 in the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Eleven Years War");LangBoxJ("GA", "Cogadh na haon deag mbliana");</script>, in which the Irish defenders, and the Roman Catholic clergy, were massacred by the English forces. The roof survived another hundred years, but was taken down in 1749.</p>
<p>Take note of the round tower in the pictures:  It is one of the best preserved areas of the ruin and is of particular interest to archaeologists for this reason. </p>
<p>As you can see from the photos I took, the Rock of Cashel is a site of remarkable accessibility (probably owing to being a site of remarkable physical stability), and very few areas were closed or fenced off. Standing in the cathedral was awe-inspiring, but I especially enjoyed two areas outside the central structure: The cemetery (with its many traditional Irish High Crosses) and Cormac&rsquo;s Chapel. Interestingly, the chapel is nestled at an odd angle to the rest of the structure, forming a tiny, but beautiful, moss-covered interior courtyard. </p>

	<p style="padding-left:20em;margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">&ndash; Hogan 1842</p>
	<p>When time ran short on our previous trip to Ireland, it became necessary to drop from the itinerary a visit to kiss the <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Blarney Stone");LangBoxJ("GA", "cloch na Blárnan");</script>, deep in <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "County Cork");LangBoxJ("GA", "Contae Chorcaí");</script>. That trip was conceived from day-one with the flexibility to amend its schedule as needed, and I didn&rsquo;t regret any of the scheduling choices &ndash; but still, missing out on this famous attraction was enough of a disappointment that I kept it lodged in the back of my mind for the time that I might have the chance to return.</p>
	<p>So when I realized that Billy and I would be back in Europe in 2009, and that it would be manageable to spend a few days in Ireland at the end of the trip, a visit to the &ldquo;Stone of Eloquence&rdquo; (as it is sometimes known) became central to our planning.</p>
	<p>Having been here twice, I think it would be fair to say that the nature of my relationship with Ireland is that it is generous in delighting me, but fickle in satisfying me. Ireland shows me what it wants to show me, with no regard to what I came to see. You&rsquo;ll see that reality unfolding on this trip as you read forward &ndash; but, at least, this time Ireland allowed me to see Blarney.</p>
	<p>Billy wasn&rsquo;t into it as much as I was, and preferred to nap in the car. While it would have been fun to have someone to share the experience with, exploring the grounds alone let me cover more area &ndash; so I guess I&rsquo;ll take that as an opportunity rather than a frustration. </p>
	<p>I really had no idea of how much there was to see at <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Blarney Castle");LangBoxJ("GA", "Caisleán An Bhlárna");</script> 
	beyond the famous stone, but it was a fantastic series of discoveries. I started at the entrance&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap02.gif' class='InlineGraphic' /> (these numbers match the &ldquo;Map of the castle grounds&rdquo; in the pictures to the right), approaching the castle along what&rsquo;s labeled on the map as Cherry Walk, and crossing a couple of bridges over River Martin. I really enjoyed how the castle&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap03.gif' class='InlineGraphic' /> came into view only gradually through the trees. </p>
	<p>By virtue of the trail&rsquo;s location, my first stop inside the castle was the dungeons&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap07.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, which were basically a dead-end cave underneath the castle. With none of the standard dungeon fare &ndash; instruments of torture, lists of famous prisoners, explanatory facts &ndash; it was as miserable for the visitor as it was for the prisoner (aside from those all-important points of not being brutalized, and of being able to leave it at will). In this, it provided an unusual educational opportunity (and one that was quite uncharacteristic of Blarney), in letting the visitor see just what squalid, execrable places these medieval dungeons would have been: essentially just caves into which one&rsquo;s enemies would be thrown and left to die &ndash; cold, hungry, and in the dark. Frankly, it haunts me a bit. </p>
	<p>Exiting the dungeon, I came around the castle, past a round tower (unnumbered on the map, and not the same round tower that is attached to the castle) and then to the main building. I think that I didn&rsquo;t know this before getting there, but Blarney Castle is an absolute ruin. Apparently, it was never a comfortable home, proving so impossible to heat that the family of Sir James St. John Jefferyes, who came to own the castle and grounds, built an adjacent mansion to live in soon after taking ownership of Blarney. I&rsquo;m sure it was completely safe, but the climb to the Stone felt adventurous over the course of twisting stairways, cantilevered walkways, and stark drops both toward the interior and exterior of the castle. It felt as if it were sheer providence that a single path up to the Stone, and another single path back to ground level, had survived the ages. Yet it bears mention that Blarney thrived under its original owner, Cormac Teige McCarthy, as well as under his descendents &ndash; including Dermot McCarthy, who in 1446 rebuilt the castle in the form that one sees today. McCarthy was at this time King of Munster, and developed Blarney into a center of culture, music, and art, undoubtedly giving rise, or support, to the perception of Munster (<a href="#FifthsOfIreland">mentioned above</a>) as having these artistic associations in the &ldquo;fifths of Ireland&rdquo; of bardic lore. </p>
	<p>I befriended a Canadian family on the way up, and they took my picture kissing the stone&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap04.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />. As you&rsquo;ve undoubtedly heard before, kissing the Stone is a challenging affair at best (and occasionally led to loss-of-life before the iron bars were introduced in the last century): One has to lay on the ground, get support as needed from the bored man whose job it is to make sure you don&rsquo;t die, wiggle out over the void, grab the iron bars, lean completely backward, and kiss the rock. Not to put too fine a point on it, but, prior to the addition of the grating, the Blarney Stone is the last thing your fingernails might scratch before the free fall to your demise.</p>
	<p>It is fairly well understood why the word &ldquo;blarney&rdquo; is associated with eloquence and empty flattery:  Queen Elizabeth I insisted to Dermot McCarthy that the castle be surrendered as a show of loyalty. He promised loyalty, at length and with great eloquence, but offered a series of less and less plausible explanations as to why the castle could not yet be surrendered. In exasperation, she read one of his letters and exclaimed, &ldquo;Odds bodikins, more Blarney talk!&rdquo; &ndash; and at that moment the word &ldquo;blarney&rdquo; entered the English vernacular.</p>
	<p>How the stone itself came to be associated with blarney (lower-case), as well as with Blarney (upper case), are questions shrouded in conjecture and, most likely, in blarney.</p>
	<p>A local legend holds that one of the kings of Munster saved an old woman from drowning. In reward, she gave him a spell that would grant him eloquence if he would kiss a stone on the top of the castle. (But this strikes me as implausible not just conceptually, but historically: We know that references to kissing the Blarney Stone date back at least to 1800 or so, and I can&rsquo;t imagine that there was much enthusiasm for the open practice of witchcraft in this period of Irish history. Also, the stone <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> at the top of the castle; it&rsquo;s actually lower than your feet when you&rsquo;re standing at the parapet of the castle)</p>
	<p>Other legends hold the stone itself to be auspicious and/or magical. Various legends hold that it is:</p>

	<p>I really spent too much time at Blarney, but I absolutely loved the place: After the castle, I went to the Rock Close&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap10.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, which was hokey, but fun. I&rsquo;m still uncertain whether it was formed by nature, by Druids, or by heavy machinery &ndash; but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Essentially, the Rock Close is an enclosed natural area, with quite a few points of interest. I especially enjoyed the boardwalk&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapA.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, the waterfall&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapB.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, the dolmen&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapC.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, the &ldquo;Wishing Steps&rdquo;&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapD.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, the &ldquo;Witches&rsquo; Kitchen&rdquo;&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapE.gif' class='InlineGraphic' /> (a fire pit in a rock area framed by large tree roots), the Druid Stones&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapH.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, the yew forest, and the &ldquo;Fairy Glade&rdquo;&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapL.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />.</p>
	<p>But I entirely let time get away from me: Realizing that the sun was nearly down, and the grounds were about the close, I scurried to the exit just as the staff were leaving to get in their cars and go home. (Immediately after this &ldquo;oh shit, what do I do now?&rdquo; moment, I realized that there was a one-way exit gate.)</p>
	<p>Really, though, I would have loved another couple of hours at Blarney. I wish I could have spent more time in the Rock Close and gone on the woodland walk&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapI.gif' class='InlineGraphic' /> and seen the sentry post&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMapJ.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />. And I would like to have seen the poison garden&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap08.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, the old limekiln&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap17.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, the icehouse&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap18.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />, and maybe (just to understand what it&rsquo;s all about) the Victorian septic tank house&nbsp;<img src='20090907/BlarneyMap13.gif' class='InlineGraphic' />. </p>

	<p>So &ndash; as I&rsquo;ve mentioned above &ndash; no matter how much planning I put into it, Ireland drives, and I just ride. But one thing that Ireland <i>did</i> allow us to see on this trip was especially spectacular: The <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Ogham Stone ");LangBoxJ("GA", "Clogh Oghaim");</script> at <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Derrynane");LangBoxJ("GA", "Doire Fhionain");</script>.</p>
	<p>Ogham stones are stone monuments carved with the Ogham writing <a href="#TitleOgham">described above</a>. They are like wheatback pennies: Not so rare as to seem mythical, but uncommon enough that you&rsquo;re not likely to see one if you don&rsquo;t make a special effort. And when you do find one, it&rsquo;s likely to show its age. Put more prosaically, there are about 400 remaining Ogham stones in the British Isles, none of them at motorway rest areas.</p>
	<p>Indeed, most of the well-preserved Ogham stones are in museums. I would even have enjoyed seeing one of those &ndash; but more viscerally, I wanted to see one in its original setting. Yet as I planned out the trip, I felt certain that this was an impossibility. I had found information that one such marker was near our destination for the night, at the end of the Kerry peninsula &ndash; but I knew we&rsquo;d be passing that area after dusk, and descriptions made it sound a bit challenging to find even in daylight. And the plan for the next day was cut so close that a visit in the morning was out of the question.</p>
	<p>Out of sheer hope, I entered &ldquo;Derrynane House&rdquo; in <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "County Kerry");LangBoxJ("GA", "Contae Chiarraí");</script> into the GPS, knowing that this would take us toward our lodging in Caherciveen, and hoping that we might see some sign of the stone on the way.</p>
	<p>By providence, our route through the grounds of the house took us past a sign for the stone, which turned out to be just a few meters off the road. There was absolutely no light (and I couldn&rsquo;t even aim the car&rsquo;s headlights in the right direction) and the ground was soggy (and even that is an optimistic description), but I have never been so happy to traipse through a bog in the pitch-black night. Seeing one of these stones where it was erected centuries ago was a spectacular opportunity. </p>

	<p>So, with my dawdling at Blarney and my detour into Derrynane, we were running quite late. I wanted to let our hosts know that we were on our way &ndash; but, unfortunately, doing so would bring me face-to-face with an old adversary, the Irish pay phone. On our previous trip, I had to pass on a convenient and affordable hotel in Dublin, and stay at an overpriced place within walking distance, because I couldn&rsquo;t get one of these things to respond to my solicitations. And now, again, I found myself staring at the bizarre symbols and strange unlabeled buttons of the device. Here is essentially the series of events:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><ol style="margin:0">
            <li>I started with the understanding, based on instructions I found somewhere, that my call was likely to cost around 25c, but that the machine wouldn&rsquo;t deign to interact with me lest I provide it four times that amount.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>I had come out of some previous transaction with a pocketful of 10c coins, but no higher denomination.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>I learned that the machines are capable of accepting only nine coins at a time. I was incapable of assembling &euro;&nbsp;1 with anything less than ten coins.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Through the kind help of a passing pedestrian, I converted my coins upward and had the following conversation with her:            </li>
          <blockquote>
            <p><b>Me:</b> Can you help me with the pay phone? The design is different from what I&rsquo;m used to in the U.S. and I&rsquo;ve never been able to get one of them to work.</p>
            <p><b>Her:</b> You just dial it and talk. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <li>Disproving her theory about how the phones work, I turned to another pedestrian, this time with Billy&rsquo;s help:</li>
          <blockquote>
            <p><b>Me:</b> Can you help me with the pay phone? The design is different from what I&rsquo;m used to in the U.S.</p>
            <p><b>Billy:</b> They <i>really are</i> different.</p>
            <p><b>Me:</b> I&rsquo;ve tried to follow the instructions, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to get a pay phone to work in Ireland.</p>
            <p><b>Him:</b> Seriously!?</p>
          </blockquote>
        </ol></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In my defense, neither of them could get it to work either. Finally the guy showed us to a different phone, and at that location the &ldquo;pay-dial-talk&rdquo; instructions did seem to bear out. I asked him what the orange buttons do, and what the symbols mean; he acted like he knew, but then he was not successful in answering the question. I eventually established a theory that the orange buttons are option buttons based on information that may, under some circumstances, display on screen. I&rsquo;m fairly certain that the third hieroglyph at the left is for volume. But &ldquo;FC,&rdquo; &ldquo;R,&rdquo; and the flag remain mysteries to me. </p>
    <p>Anyway, the people at O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s B&amp;B were enormously understanding and accommodating, and were ready for us when we finally arrived in 
      <script>LangBoxJ("EN", "Caherciveen");LangBoxJ("GA", "Cathair Saidhbhín");</script> at about 10:00 PM.</p>
    <p>They showed us to a very pleasant room, with wall paper in a nice shade of pink that was clearly selected to calm guests down after they have been forced to use an Irish pay phone. It&rsquo;s details like this that help a country get to #5 on the Human Development Index. (But I think the continued existence of these phones is why they&rsquo;re lagging at #12 on the Global Peace Index.)</p>
    <p>But if there&rsquo;s anything that will help you forget the electronics in a European county, it&rsquo;s the plumbing. One could walk from Miami to Seattle and probably encounter no more than two types of toilet flushes, and maybe three different configurations of sink and shower faucets. In Europe, adjacent rooms may be different. And it&rsquo;s a total crapshoot whether  the cold is on the right or the left (and, indeed, whether it is labeled). Our hubris was such that we thought we had seen everything after five trips to Europe, taking us into sixteen different countries &ndash; but here was something new: The shower was electronic, with one knob to select pressure, one to select temperature, and a button to turn it on.</p>
