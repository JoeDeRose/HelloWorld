<p>It is easy in 2010 to see Israel as the powerful aggressor, and nothing
	more -- and to think of the abuses that led to the creation of the State of
	Israel (horrific though they were) as having been a continent away, deeply
	affecting the people perhaps, but not necessarily the land. In 2010 it is very
	easy to forget how hard-won Jerusalem was for the Jewish people, and how
	many enemies had to be fought to get it. Alas, the Western Wall is the nexus
	for many of the bitterest of these memories.</p>
<p>The tension between Muslims and Jews around this land is well-known and deeply
	rooted -- but some of the cruelest atrocities were perpetrated by the British
	troups who ostensibly kept the peace, but who in practice kept their own
	station by playing the two sides against each other regardless of the consequence.
	The moral nadir of the British &quot;protectorate&quot; came in the late 1920s,
	in the context of enforcement of an Ottoman decree banning new construction
	at the Western Wall. The British interpreted &quot;construction&quot; in a ludicrously
	broad sense, and pursued their enforcement with a ludicrously heavy hand:
	In the British mind, &quot;construction&quot; forbade the use of chairs, even
	by the elderly in the
	desert heat -- and whenever they would see grandmothers and grandfathers
	praying in chairs at the wall, they would without warning yank those chairs
	out from under the person heedless of the insult or injury they might cause.
	Indeed, there was a British functionary stationed at the wall for whom this
	was the sole job responsibility. Worse, when a temporary {{mechitza}} was
	set up to divide men from women during prayer, as is customary in orthodox
	Judaism, the British seized the wooden slats of the partition and used them
	to beat the women who had set it up. And when the British were not physically
	abusing the Jewish population, they ignored their plight altogether: British
	indifference led to rising tensions
	in 1929, culminating in what is known as the {{Western_Wall_Uprising}} --
	a disturbance that began at the Western Wall, and spread throughout Palestine.
	In one particularly noxious incident, British soldiers looked on without
	action as they watched Jews massacred by an Arab crowd by the Jaffa Gate.
	So grievous and famous was the British government's
	mishandling of Palestine that the League of Nations approved a British requst
	for a commision on the status of the Western Wall only under the condition
	that no British citizen could serve on it.</p>
<p>Affronts -- both trivial and grievous -- to Jews worshiping at the Western
	Wall continued in the following decades: Muslims would try to disrupt Jewish
	religious services with noise or animal drives past the wall, and by allowing
	animal excrement to accumulate in the alleys leading to it. And the League of
	Nations ruled that -- while Jews must be given access to the prayer space --
	the use of a {{shofar}}, the ram's horn used in religious observance in Judaism,
	was forbidden there; this edict was ignored every year at {{Yom_Kippur}}, resulting
	in imprisonment for up to six months for the person who fulfilled the obligation
	of blowing the shofar.</p>
<p>So dire was the situation of Jews under the {{British_Mandate_for_Palestine}}
	that the one of the Zionist organizations there, the <span class="dropnote">Lehi</span><span class="downarrow">➴¹</span> group,
	made an overture to Hitler's
	Nazi government <span class="dropnote">in 1940</span><span class="downarrow">➴²</span> to assist in
	transferring Jews
	out of Germany in exchange for the Third Reich's assistance in expelling
	the British from Palestine.</p>

<p>It's hard to envision the world of 2010 had this proposal succeeded: Jewish
	lives spared, but at the cost of validating and institutionalizing European
	anti-Semitism. In any event, the communication was never answered, and <span class="dropnote">six

						punish its enemies -- coming from the root word {{decem}}
						and meaning &quot;to
						reduce by one tenth&quot;. In practice the reduction of a
						population by one tenth was so brutal, so crushing to
						the spirit of the survivors, that the term
						&quot;decimate&quot; came to be a synonym for &quot;utter destruction&quot;. At
						the hands of the Nazis, <i>one third</i> of the world's Jews were wiped
						from the face of the earth.</td>

<p>Even at the end of World War II, when the British were patting themselves
	on the back for being one of the Allied powers that liberated the Jews in
	Germany, they were still enforcing anti-Semitic policies in Palestine that
	resulted in the humiliation, mistreatment, and death of Jews: Beyond a small
	quota that were permitted entry by the British, the vast majority of Jews
	had to enter Palestine surrepticiously -- even if they had no home nor safe
	harbor in their countries of origin; even if they were struggling to regroup
	and rebuild after seeing their businesses destroyed, their homes and property
	stolen, and their families murdered in German concentration camps -- and
	were treated as illegal immigrants if discovered. Further, British laws made
	it illegal to sell property to Jews, regardless
	of their legal status, in 95% of the Mandate area.</p>
<p>Very few could be said to owe the scurrilous Nazis a debt of gratitude --
	but it may be that such a debt is owed by the British: Had not the swastika
	been so tainted with blood, had the Lehi group's offer -- even with its vile
	undertones -- been accepted, it might well be the Union Jack that we look
	on with revulsion when we think of the suffering of innocent Jews.</p>
<p>Lest you think I exaggerate the sins of the British, I draw your attention
	to the circumstances under which journalist Ruth Gruber took her most famous
	photograph. Gruber was in Haifa when the British Royal Navy attacked the <i>Exodus
	1947</i>, a ship carrying 4,500 Holocaust survivors to what was then still the
	British Mandate for Palestine. Rather than be allowed to stay in a place
	of relative safety after having been rescued from the killing factories of
	the Nazi regime, these refugees were placed aboard the British prison ship <i>Runnymede
	Park</i>, housed in wire cages, and carried back to Germany -- the nation that
	had fought a world war in order to criminalize their very existence.
	The refugees left no doubt as to their feelings on the collusion between
	Allies and Axis at this juncture: In the confines of their prison ship they
	raised a Union Jack on which they had painted a swastika. And Ruth Gruber
	made journalistic history when she captured the image of their protest.</p>

<p>When the British were finally expelled, and an Israeli state was established,
	Israel was immediately attacked by its neighbors in the {{1948_Arab_Israeli_War}},
	the resolution of which left the rest of the world with the impression of
	Israel as a <span class="dropnote">powerhouse</span><span class="downarrow">➴¹</span> --
	but left Israel with a feeling of profound loss: The Western Wall
	was on the other side of the Green Line -- and the government of Jordan would

<p>The length and depth of this struggle may explain, but not excuse, the swiftness
	and relentlessness of the Israeli response when in June 1967 it came into
	possession of the Old City at the end of the {{Six_Day_War}}: When Israeli
	paratroopers landed at the base of the Western Wall, the gathering space
	at the foot of it was a narrow street, only
	[[4_m]] wide between the wall and the houses of the 800-year-old {{Moroccan_Quarter}}.
	Two days later, the Moroccan Quarter residents were told to leave their homes
	and never return -- and then within hours bulldozers started flattening
	those homes without regard to whether the people inside had heeded, or even
	heard, the warning; several died under the tumbling stone walls of their
	former neighborhood. And thus the congregation area at the Western Wall grew
	tenfold, to [[40_m]], and the vast [[2_ha]] Western Wall Plaza took the place
	of this once-thriving neighborhood, forming a direct, open connection between
	the wall and the {{Jewish_Quarter}}.</p>
<p>Everything I've written about above was awful. And everything now is ... different.
	 Far from being viewed as a forbidden construction,
	a very solid mechitza now
	 divides the Western Wall into a prayer area for men on the left, and for
	 women on the right. Some women, of course, cherish this divider just as
	they did when they faced British wrath in setting one up in 1928 -- but for
	others it represents a expression of Judaism that does not match their own
	experience, aspirations, or faith. Now it is not the <span class="dropnote">orthodox</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> Jews
	trying to blow the shofar who face prosecution for their expression of Judaism
	at this holy place, but rather the members of {{Women_of_the_Wall}}, who
	believe in gender equality in religious expression, but who have faced waves
	of prosecution and persecution for attempting to practice the Jewish faith,
	as <i>they</i> embrace
	it, at the Western Wall.</p>

<p>And even devout orthodox women, who have no wish to challenge the separation,
	can and do make claims of discrimination: The women's
	prayer area is but a third of the total, which is an unfair inequality in
	the contexts of Jewish law and simple math -- but worse in the context of
	orthodox practice: Men, by orthodox custom, are allowed to pray in a {{minyan}}
	while women are required to pray individually. The clustering effect reminds
	one of the restroom situation in most office buildings: Women
	need more space, but are allotted less.</p>
<p>But no one -- regardless of her or his philosophy, faith, or practice --
	can reasonably come to Jerusalem without a visit to the Western Wall. And
	this is what Mom and I did as our first act on our first morning in the Holy
	Land: We made our way down David Street from our hotel to the Western Wall
	Plaza, walking through its metal detectors and
	then through its ghosts, and finally arrived at that point which is at the
	bottom of the hill, but at the apex of Jewish heritage and the fulcrum
	of the State of Israel: The Western Wall.</p>
<p>Mom went to the right to explore the women's section, and I went to the left
to explore the men's.  Both sections include areas beyond the view of the Western
Wall Plaza: The women's section includes a small enclave by
	Robinson's Arch under the walkway that leads up to the Temple Mount. And
	the men's section includes a <span class="dropnote">large warren of rooms</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> under
the elevated Muslim quarter, leading under Wilson's Arch, stocked with books

<p>The {{Western_Wall_Tunnel}} is the public portion of an excavation under the
	{{Muslim_Quarter}}, which was elevated centuries ago to provide easier access
	to the Haram ash-Shareef (Temple Mount) after Muslims took control. The high
	retaining walls (such as the Western Wall) that created a hard-to-reach and
	elite space were fully in keeping with the sacredness of that plaza under
	Jewish control during the eras of the First and Second Temples -- but suited
	neither the theology nor the logistical needs of the Muslim populace. The
	effect was a forgotten, underground city, essentially preserved in time --
	a Disneyland for archaeologists.</p>
<p>These excavations were begun by the British in 1864 and continue to this day
	-- continue, indeed, with such progress that, like Disneyland, the Western Wall
	Tunnel tour welcomes visitors with new attractions every year: Mom and I concluded
	our tour by walking through multiple chambers of the Struthion Pool, which had
	a much smaller footprint on the tour when Billy and I visited
	in 2007.</p>
<p>Alas, for reasons that are a mystery to me now, I didn't take any pictures
	during the tour despite the fact that photography was not prohibited at any
	point. So you'll have to go back to my <a href="../2007-3Continents/day08/day08.htm" target="_blank">2007

<p>The {{Via_Dolorosa}} is, <i>abstractly</i>, the path followed by Jesus on
	the way to his crucifixion; <i>broadly</i>, one well-known route in Jerusalem
	that represents the portion of this journey
	on which Jesus carried the cross, and that incorporates stops at each of
	the fourteen traditional &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot;; and <i>narrowly</i>,
	the name of the street in the Jerusalem where this route begins and where
	the first eight stations of the cross are sited.</p>
<p>The coordinates of these stations of the cross are dubious in
	the extreme -- and this is not just me talking; even the faithful come here
	with the wish to follow in Jesus's example, but knowing that they are unlikely
	to follow in his footsteps. First, the streets may not even be where they
	were in that era: This Jerusalem
	shares a name and location with the Jerusalem of Jesus's time -- but the
	First Jewish-Roman War followed Jesus's execution by about forty years, and
	in the words of {{Josephus}} the
	city was 
	&quot;so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations,
	that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once
	been a place of habitation&quot;. The Romans built their new city, {{Aelia_Capitolina}}
	in that same place -- but using a street pattern traditional to Roman cities,
	one that likely varied substantially from the one in the city they had just
	destroyed.</p>
<p>Second, even within the constraints of the current layout, uncertainty about
	the locations runs very deep: In the Middle
	Ages, the Roman Catholic Church in Jerusalem split into two factions, with
	those that controlled the western hill favoring a route of the Via Dolorosa
	that passed churches under their sway, and those that controlled the eastern
	hill predictably favoring a route that took pilgrims past their own institutions
	-- a situation that persisted until Pope Clement VI issued a bull, {{Nuper_Carissimae}},
	establishing Fransiscan control over the Holy Land, and thus, by extension,
	allowing them to entrench their eastern-hill understanding of the Via Dolorosa, <span class="dropnote">which
	we still follow to this day</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>. Ironically,
	though, modern archaeological evidence strongly suggests that the western
	hill crowd may have been much closer to the target.</p>

<p>Finally, the stations themselves are suspect -- not just <i>where</i> they
	happened, but <i>whether</i> they happened. And again, this is not just me talking:
	There is absolutely no scriptural foundation for stations 3, 4, 6, 7, and
	9 (the three falls; Jesus meeting his mother; and Veronica wiping Jesus's
	face), and a &quot;Scriptural
	Way of the Cross&quot; to supersede the traditional Stations of the Cross was
	advocated by no less a luminary than {{Pope_John_Paul_II}} in 1991, and
	reaffirmed by his successor, {{Pope_Benedict_XVI}} in 2007. We'll get to
	the traditional stations anon, but here's John Paul II's version:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b> Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus is betrayed by Judas and
		arrested,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus is condemned by the {{Sanhedrin}},</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus is denied
		by Peter,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus is judged by Pilate</b> (corresponds to traditional Station 1)<b> ,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus is scourged and crowned
		with thorns,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus takes up His cross</b> (corresponds to traditional Station 2)<b>,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus is helped by Simon
		to carry His cross</b> (corresponds to traditional Station 5)<b>,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem</b> (corresponds to traditional Station
		8)<b>,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus
		is crucified</b> (corresponds to traditional Station 11)<b>,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus promises His kingdom to the repentant thief,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus entrusts Mary and John to each other,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus dies on the
		cross</b> (corresponds to traditional Station 12)<b>,</b></li>
	<li><b>Jesus is laid in the tomb</b> (corresponds to traditional Station 14)<b>. </b></li>
	</ol>
<p>Anyway, the stations are an odd assortment of landmarks of diminishing interest
	-- &quot;diminishing&quot;, that is, until one gets inside the Church of the
	Holy Sepulchre, where all heaven breaks loose. It starts with an open courtyard
	(Station 1); then a few ornate chapels (2-4); then a few closed doors (5-7);
	then a stone set in the wall (8); and finally an unadorned wall (9) -- representing
	the following events:</p>
<ol>
	<li> <b>Jesus is condemned to death</b><br />
		The starting point is in a courtyard of the Muslim
			{{Umariya_Elementary_School}}. Muslims greatly revere {{Jesus}},
			whom they, too, <span class="dropnote">recognize as the messiah</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>,
			and also consider one of the prophets of Islam -- so in general they
			welcome persons of all faiths who are looking for the starting point
			of the Via Dolorosa. But the scholastic obligations of this building
			take precedence, and for that reason it is often closed to the public.
			Thus, an alternate 1st Station is on the other side of the street
			in the <b>Church
		of the Condemnation and Imposition of the Cross</b>. This may seem a little
		free-wheeling to you, but console yourself with the fact that we're almost
		certainly not even in the right part of town: Recent discoveries in both
		the historical and archaeological record mutually reinforce the
		location of Pilate's judgment as having been in Herod's palace, near
		what is now the Jaffa Gate, and also reveal that what we call the 1st
		Station was actually an open cistern when Jesus walked Jerusalem. As
		the remaining eight stations fall in pretty much a straight line between
		here and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, this recent evidence makes
		them all suspect -- a fact that Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem seem
		to be aware of, but not daunted by, as they follow this route among the
		stations of the cross.<br />

<p>Jerusalem is characterized as a nexus of discord between the dominant
	Abrahamic religions -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. But the Church of
	the Holy Sepulchre is marred by such disagreement between the factions of
	its own Christian faith that intercession by the others is indispensible
	to keeping the peace. The keys to the church are not even
	held by Christians, but rather by members of the Muslim {{Joudeh}}
	and {{Nusseibeh}} families, who have been entrusted for eight centuries with
	a job that they are expected to retain for all time -- that most basic of
	church functions: letting people in. Every morning, a member of the
	Joudeh family brings the keys to the church and hands them to a member
	of the Nusseibeh family; the latter unlocks the door and returns the
	keys, which are then taken back to the Joudeh home.
	The process is repeated in reverse each evening.</p>
<p>And in another regular event, the <span class="dropnote">miracle</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> of
	the Holy Fire that has been celebrated at the church on Holy Saturday
	of every year since 1106, it is Jewish authorities who are brought into the
	church at the behest of the bickering Christian factions within. In this
	event, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem is inspected by the aforementioned
	Jewish authorities to confirm that he carries no device capable of starting
	a flame before being allowed to enter the holy sepulchre with only a bundle
	of thirty-three white candles. As the congregation outside chants {{Kyrie_eleison}},
	the Holy Fire is said to descend on the interior of the tomb and light the
	candles. The patriarch emerges within a half hour, the candles blazing.</p>

<p>But it is the physical space, rather than the temporal events, that highlight
	the challenges of sharing in this particular sandbox: The church houses six
	denominations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The {{Greek_Orthodox_Church}},</li>
	<li>The {{Roman_Catholic_Church}},</li>
	<li>The {{One_Holy_Universal_Apostolic_Orthodox_Armenian_Church}},</li>
	<li>The {{Syriac_Orthodox_Patriarchate_of_Antioch_and_All_the_East}},</li>
	<li>The {{Coptic_Orthodox_Patriarchate_of_Alexandria_and_of_All_Africa}}, and</li>
	<li>The {{Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church}}.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these sects are represented <i>sui generis</i>, but the Roman Catholic
	holdings fall under a single individual, the {{Custodian_of_the_Holy_Land}},
	an official of the {{Order_of_Friars_Minor}} -- AKA the Franciscans -- who
	represents the Pope in Jerusalem. (At the time of our visit, this person
	was a man by the name of Pierbattista Pizzaballa.)</p>
<p>But the space is not divided evenly; rather, the Greek Orthodox Church gets
	the lion's share, with the best of the remaining sections going to the Roman
	Catholic and Armenian Orthodox churches. Late entrants in the Nineteenth
	Century, the remaining groups are given rights only to lesser chapels on
	the periphery of the building -- with the holdings of the Ethiopian Orthodox <span class="dropnote">Tawahedo</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> Church
	being almost ridiculous in their meagerness: A group of hovels on the roof
	of the building in which its monks reside (and the ownership of which is
	even disputed by the Copts), and a couple of small
	chapels alongside a staircase from that rooftop to the courtyard in front
	of the church's main entrance. The premium spots are shared -- but not evenly:
	Jesus's tomb is the province of the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Armenian
	Orthodox sects exclusively. And there are two side-by-side chapels -- Greek
	Orthodox and Roman Catholic -- atop Calvary. Common areas are shared by all
	faiths with the exception of the front door, which is under the control of
	the aforementioned Muslim families.</p>

<p>&quot;Cooperation&quot; within the common areas is governed by an agreement
	called the &quot;Status Quo&quot;, which defines the areas of control for each
	of the six groups and mandates that changes in the common areas must be agreed
	upon by all parties. Far from easing tensions and facilitating interaction,
	however, the <span class="dropnote">Status Quo</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> instead
	has put the building into a state of eternal inertia that in some cases is
	amusing, and in others is negligent to the point of risking catastrophe:
	In the former camp, there rests above the entrance to the church a ladder
	that happened to be in place when the Status Quo was signed in 1853. It's
	not needed; indeed, it was just propped up at that time for some long-forgotten
	maintenance. But because it falls in a common area all six factions would
	have to agree simultaneously to its removal,
	and that has not happened in the 157 years since the agreement was penned.
	So the ladder remains. And it does not merely <i>remain</i>: It is even replaced,
	per the obligations of the Status Quo, when it periodically rots.</p>

<p>On the &quot;negligent to the point of risking catastrophe&quot; side, the
	edicule (the tomb building inside the church) is in desperate need of repair,
	but renovations have been delayed because of how the various groups fear
	the construction process and completed project would affect their areas of
	control under the Status Quo. A repair of the dome was completed in 1997,
	and was heralded as a miracle of unity between the groups -- but could only
	be achieved to avoid the impending nightmare of having the church's dome
	crash to the ground, destroying the tomb of Jesus and slaying his worshipers.
	The door that I've mentioned above is the <i>only</i> door to the building,
	and has proved so woefully inadequate
	as an escape route when fires have broken out in the building that the groups
	agreed in 1999 to build another door; eleven years have passed, and making
	the decision is as far as they've got.</p>
<p>Finally there's this: The city of Jerusalem recently revoked the exemption
	it had granted to synagogues, mosques, and churches for their water consumption.
	All of the other religious institutions in the city have complied with the new
	requirement -- but at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre they have so far dodged
	the obligation because they are unable to form an agreement as to who will
	receive the bill.</p>
<p>But it's not always fun and games (unless the term &quot;monk fight&quot; amuses
	you, in which case it is): In 2002 a Coptic monk moved his chair into the
	shade, which a nearby Ethopian monk interpreted as a forbidden encroachment
	in violation of the Status Quo; eleven people were hospitalized as a result
	of the ensuing fight. In
	2008, a Greek monk was ejected from the building by a rival; when police
	were called to the church, they, too, were seized upon by the rioting clergy.</p>
<p>And all this for a plot of land that is of dubious historical significance
	at best: None of the Protestant faiths recognize this as the burial site of
	Jesus, nor of the crucifixion (which they don't always put in such proximity
	that they would fit in a single building anyway). And a belief in these loci
	is not a tenet of faith for any sect, including the ones that so jealously guard
	it.</p>

<p>Still, the biggest criticism is one that they <i>do</i> have an answer for:
	People are forever exclaiming, &quot;How could this be the site of the crucifixion?
	It's right in the middle of downtown!&quot; Because Jerusalem is <i>so</i> old,
	and because this part of Jerusalem is called the &quot;Old City&quot;, it is
	easy to assume that these neighborhoods reflect the original layout. But,
	in fact, the current city walls date only to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent
	in 1538. In Jesus's time they were indisputably different, as the following
	maps help illustrate:</p>

<p>That word &quot;safely&quot;, however, is the bugbear: &quot;Calvary&quot; is
	short for &ldquo;<i>Mount</i> Calvary&quot;, and other archaeologists point out
	that it would be nonsensical -- a threat to the <i>safety</i> of the citizens
	-- to put a defensive wall adjacent to Calvary, leaving the Tyrop&oelig;on Valley
	(which was indisputably inside the walls) vulnerable to attack from that
	very hilltop. Many historians are of the view that a city with the power
	and wealth of Jerusalem would not be led to such a decision, neither by compromise
	nor by mistake. The following cross-section of Jerusalem illustrates the relative
	positions and the reason that a wall adjacent to Calvary would be a bad defensive design:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="day02/JerusalemCrossSection.PNG" width="451" height="235" style="border:1px black solid;"/></p>
<p>In any event, we will not soon know the definitive answer: The meager archaeological
	evidence that has been collected is inconclusive. And ongoing digging in this
	part of the world moves very, very, very slowly, for scientific, political,
	and theological reasons. Likely, though our lifetimes, the location of Calvary
	will remain a matter of faith.</p>

<p>The interior of the church is (at least in my perception) an incomprehensible
	mess. Now you might accurately fault me for a less-than-adequate grounding
	in the Sunday-School curriculum -- but no such accusation could ever be made
	of my mother. Still, neither of us had the vaguest idea what was going on
	when we entered the church: First, the space is not organized in any way
	that is familiar -- no main altar, no pews, no discernable nave. And the
	word I keep coming back to for its organization and apparent growth pattern
	is &quot;tumorous&quot;: More
	than a dozen chapels are scattered around, on many different levels -- but
	unlabeled as to their heritage and significance. And I'm embarrassed to report
	this, but I had been in this church three times (once in 2007 and twice on
	this trip), and Mom had been in it twice, before either of us comprehended
	that Calvary was actually <i>inside</i> it. Anyway, here are a few images to
	familiarize you (to whatever extent you may wish) with the church's physical
	plant:</p>

<p>But Calvary is indeed inside it. Give me a second on the name, though, before
	we get to the site -- for you may wonder why we refer to this place interchangeably
	as &quot;Calvary&quot; and &quot;Golgotha&quot;: &quot;Calvary&quot; is
	the English name for what comes to us from the original scriptures as &ldquo;<i>Golgotha
	(which means <span class="forceLSQUO">'</span>The Place of the Skull&rsquo;)</i>&rdquo;. (This
	is Matthew 27:33 in the New International Version -- but the wording is similar
	in all four gospels.) Anyway, the parentheses aren't part of
	every translation, but the &quot;which
	means <span class="dropnote">'The Place of the Skull'</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span>&quot; is
	clearly an afterthought in all versions; the name of the mountain is {{Golgotha}}
	(or some cognate thereof), and nothing else. The translation -- &quot;Place
	of the Skull&quot; -- was offered as a helpful explanation by all four
	evangelists in their gospels to an audience reading in something other than
	Aramaic (usually Greek), and itself translates to Latin as {{Calvariae_Locus}}.
	Fast-forward a few hundred years to the King James translation, where they
	were working with this Latin version among other sources, and you will
	find that the translation team got it right in Matthew, Mark, and John --
	but the slackers who were working on Luke decided to go with an anglicized
	version of this Latin term, and thus referred to the mountain as &quot;Calvary&quot; instead
	of &quot;Golgotha&quot;:</p>

&nbsp;	</li>

		Pretty much on the line between the Greek Orthodox and Fransiscan chapels.

	around us commented amongst themselves, and occasionally to us, &quot;What is
	this again?&quot; &quot;What happened here?&quot; &quot;What's the significance of this chapel?&quot;
	-- and I strongly suspect that this was the conversational topic in all of

<p>At the 9th Station of the cross, we were invited by an English- (and only
	English-) language sign to view the cistern inside the Queen Helen Coptic
	Orthodox Church -- named for {{Saint_Helena}}, mother of {{Constantine_the_Great}}.
	Saint Helena, credited with finding the relics of the True Cross,
	is canonized in Roman Catholic as well as Orthodox traditions; indeed, she
	is the patron saint of new discoveries -- so
	who could argue with such a diversion? (Well, because of the dark, steep,
	and slippery staircase, Mom could. But I made a quick trip down to the bowels
	of the church while she waited by the street.)</p>
<p>The cistern below this church was discovered by Saint Helena in the 4th Century
	CE, and provided water for drinking and for building the Church of the Holy
	Sepulchre.</p>
<p>The sign promised
	a musical
	surpise if we
	sang a hymn in the echo-chamber of the cistern, and that promise was delivered
	in spades: As I approached on the steps, I could hear a faint sound of &quot;Amazing
	Grace&quot;,
	which I first assumed to be a recording. But as I entered the dim chamber,
	I found the sound to be coming from one of the many pilgrims to Jerusalem,
	playing a favorite hymn on a harmonica he had brought with him on his journey.
	He finished the song a short time after I arrived (giving me enough time
	to enjoy the echoing strains of the familiar tune), and then was thanked
	with a thunderous applause as the ten-or-so of us in the cistern clapped
	in approval in the cistern's echoing expanse.</p>

<p>Clambering up and around these structures like these -- in castles throughout
	Europe; in the pyramids of Central America; in temples along the Nile --
	has always been a childlike joy for me. Jerusalem, absolutely, was no exception
	-- but the weight of history in Jerusalem not only waxes far more distant
	than in most places I've seen; it also wanes much more recent. So the ramparts
	for me were something much more than a fun diversion into a labyrinth with some
	interesting views: They were a dive into a history as weighty as the stones
	themselves.</p>
<p>Walled cities, of course, weren't built with the amusement of tourists in
	mind; they existed to protect their citizens from a hostile outside world
	-- and it may be true that the walls of Jerusalem hewed to this function
	more and longer perhaps than any other such fortifications on the planet.
	It was <span class="dropnote">under these walls</span><span class="downarrow">➴</span> that the knights of the {{Crusades}} fought the soldiers
	of the {{Great_Seljuq_Empire}} for the right of Christians to
	enter Jerusalem. But it was also here -- and within my lifetime -- that the
	{{Jordanian_Armed_Forces}} perched behind these same crenelations and fired
	into the streets of {{West_Jerusalem}} in the hope of convincing Jewish
	settlers that <i>this</i> was not going to
	be the safe space for which they yearned. And it was into the space framed
	by these ramparts that the {{Israel_Defense_Forces}} sent paratroopers at
	the end of the Six-Day War to strike fear into their opponents throughout
	the region and throughout the world, and to establish the claim that yes,
	in fact, it was.</p>

<p>Mom wanted a little time to rest before dinner, so I took the opportunity
	to visit a place high on my list: The neighborhood of
	{{Mea_Shearim}}, one of the most reluctant tourist attractions in the world.</p>
<p>Mea Shearim is a {{Haredi}} neighborhood just outside the gates of the Old
	City -- famous for its history, for its politics, and especially for its
	ungracious
	accommodation
	with regard to the interest of outsiders. Although I got slightly lost --
	and received, it must be acknowledged, helpful directions from a Haredi shopkeeper
	along the way -- I knew I was in the right place when I saw the famous modesty
	placards above an entrance to the neighborhood:</p>

<p>I typically don't go for the &quot;look like a local&quot; approach to travel
	anyway -- but here  it wasn't even remotely an option,
	unless I could somehow, magically and instantly, come by a beard,
	sidelocks, a wide-brimmed hat, and a full-length suit jacket. So my standard
	approach of being myself in the context of showing respect for the locals
	had to carry the day (perhaps with a greater-than-usual emphasis on the showing
	respect side of the equation). I had
	done my research and I think I pulled it off: I arrived
	alone rather than in a group; I wore dark colors and
	a conservative style; I avoided interactions and never took pictures of people.
	And at the end of the day, I was eyed suspiciously on multiple occasions,
	but never greeted
	with hostility. I believe that is the best that can be expected at Mea Shearim.</p>
<p>The name means &quot;hundredfold&quot;, taken from a verse
	in the {{Toledot}} section of the the {{weekly_Torah_portion}} ascribed to
	the week that the settlement was founded:</p>
<table class="LangTable">

		<th class="LangEN" title="English"><span class="LangDesignator">EN</span></th>
		<td class="LangTextEN"><b>Genesis 26:12</b><br />Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the Lord blessed him.</td>

	</tr>
</table>
<p>The number 100 comes up repeatedly in the early history of Mea Shearim --
	and I have been unable to find sources that even remark the coincidence, let
	alone mention whether it was intentional or providential. Even so, here's
	what I've found: The community
	was founded by 100 shareholders in 1874. By 1880 there were 100 apartments ready
	for occupancy, which were assigned by lottery (so obviously not to the original 100).
	The name can also be translated as &quot;hundred gates&quot;, and commentaries
	exist that the community was once surrounded by exactly that: 100 gates (a claim
	that I find inconceivable in light of the tiny number of streets, entrances,
	and acres/ares
	that describe this small neighborhood).</p>
<p>Mea Shearim was one of the earliest efforts by
	this group of shareholders in establishing living quarters outside of the
	Old City, which at that point had become overcrowded and unsanitary, and has
	preserved a Jewish way of life within its walls that is unique even within the
	context of the modern state of Israel. First, most residents reject the use
	of Hebrew as a street language, believing it should be reserved for religious
	use; for casual conversation they prefer Yiddish (which is why my non-scriptural
	references in this section also include Yiddish, even though most of these
	examples differ little from Hebrew). But more interestingly, Mea Shearim is
	the nexus of the Jewish anti-Zionist movement in Israel.</p>
<p>The Zionist movement, and the establishment of the State of Israel, are founded
	in a historical notion of {{Aliyah}}, a concept generally embraced in both
	the religious and secular Jewish worlds and enshrined is Israel's {{Law_of_Return}}.
	Aliyah encourages a return to Israel and has generally been
	taken as an endorsement for the establishment of the State of Israel -- but
	certain groups, notable among them Mea Shearim's {{Neturei_Karta}}, believe
	that the establishment of Israel as a nation,  prior to the coming
	of the messiah, is sinful. Naturei Karta espouses
	a peaceful dismantling of the State of Israel, and has worked aggressively
	with the country's enemies -- various Palestinian factions and the government
	of Iran -- to bring about that circumstance, and simultaneously to separate
	the concepts of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism; they have also been a fervent
	voice for better treatment of Palestinians inside and outside of Israel.
	Farther to the extreme is the {{Sikrikim}} group, named for the {{Sicarii}},
	who attempted to expel Rome in the decades prior to the fall of Jerusalem
	in 70 CE by using concealed {{sicae}} to stab both the Roman occupiers and
	wealthy Jews who were comfortable under Roman rule. The Sikrikim, named as &quot;terrorists&quot; by
	many in the Israeli government, take this fight to the modern day -- most
	notably by inflicting over [[250000_ILS]] in damages to a bookstore near their
	headquarters that refused to quit stocking Zionist literature and throwing stones
	at Israeli police who enter the neighborhood. (They've also been involved
	in terroristic activity not specifically associated with their anti-Zionist
	stance, such as hurling eggs and rocks at children attending a girls schools
	that they thought allowed
	immodest dress 
	and breaking the nose
	and finger of an electronics store owner whose portable video players enraged
	the Sikrikim.) It is common in Mea Shearim to see anti-Zionist placards, one
	of which is in my photograph group below.</p>
<p>Dialog regarding community standards among the residents of Mea Shearim is accomplished
	largely by those same placards, {{pashkvilim}}, placed throughout the neighborhood
	on public walls. A pashkvil that survives may be considered a community standard;
	one that is covered over may be considered controversial at best.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning at this point is the use of &quot;G-D&quot; on the English
	side of the pashkvil that begins by addressing itself &quot;TO WOMEN &amp; GIRLS&quot;.
	This is a carry-over into English of a requirement in Hebrew regarding the circumstances
	under which the name of God can be written, and how it must be handled once
	such writing is done. These requirements are generally not considered an issue
	of faith in languages other than Hebrew, but omitting the vowel in English echoes
	ways that the issue is handled in Hebrew and is often done by observant Jews
	as a sign of respect.</p>

<p>Finally, I made my way back to the Old City, reconnoitered with Mom at the
	hotel, and took her to a restaurant that Billy and I had fondly enjoyed during
	our previous visit to Jerusalem: the Armenian Tavern. I tend to the nostalgic
	in these situations, and had a dish of minced meat in grape leaves that I had
	enjoyed in 2007, called khaghoghi derev. But I did branch out for the dessert
	course and ordered a rolled fruit sausage-like thing that was inoffensive
	to the taste, but, to be frank, looked like a caramel-covered turd.</p>
