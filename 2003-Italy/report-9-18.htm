  <li>The entire reason that we were in Milan was to see Leonardo da Vinci's <u>
  <b><i>The Last Supper</i></b></u>, so we started out early for <u><b>Santa 
  Maria delle Grazie</b></u> to meet our reserved showing.&nbsp; (It was only 
  after our return to the U.S. that some confusion about the name of this 
  masterpiece was resolved:&nbsp; In Italian it is referred to alternately as <i>
  L'Ultima Cena</i> and <i>Il Cenacolo</i>; the former means &quot;the last supper&quot;; 
  the latter is the name of the room in which the Biblical story of the last 
  supper took place.)&nbsp; One hears about the faded masterpiece of light 
  pastels that has suffered over time through incompetent restoration attempts 
  in previous centuries, the contempt of Napoleon Bonaparte's troops who used 
  its refectory home as a stable, and the destruction of the 
  room (but not this wall, nor Donato Montorfano's <i>Crucifixion</i> on the 
  facing wall) by Allied bombs in World War II.&nbsp; In the context of such 
  preparation, we were delighted and astounded to see that the restoration 
  presented us with a vibrant and deep painting, which we were assured was a 
  restoration and not a recreation, that could be thoroughly seen and 
  experienced (thoroughly, that is, except for the door through Jesus's feet 
  that was installed in 1652 to give access to the kitchen).&nbsp; Much effect 
  was created with an extremely dim room and specific illumination of the 
  painting – but this effect was brilliant for its simplicity and brought <i>The 
  Last Supper</i> to life.</li>

  <li>After <i>The Last Supper</i>, we took a <b>tram</b> back to the Speronari to 
  retrieve our luggage and depart.&nbsp; I had long thought that European-style 
  streetcars would be the salvation of American cities; it was Milan that changed my 
  mind on this subject.&nbsp; A single line in a grassy median, such as the St. 
  Charles streetcar in New Orleans, is unique and pleasant.&nbsp; A jumble 
  of overhead wires and clusters of trams clogging the streets is much less 
  appealing.&nbsp; It did give Milan a certain urban feel that was nice in its 
  place, but that would be to the detriment of any city in which it is newly 
  installed.</li>

  <li>Our work in Milan done, we made our way to Milan's <u><b>Stazione 
  Centrale</b></u> for our train ride to Venice.&nbsp; Although the four of us 
  had arrived here the previous day, and Billy and I had come again that 
  evening to purchase our tickets for today's trip, this was the first opportunity we had taken 
  to look at the station and enjoy its architecture.&nbsp; Milano Centrale, 
  brought to its current design in 1931, is described as one of the finest 
  examples of fascist architecture; it was indeed an amazing building to 
  behold.</li>

  <li>Not only was the station enjoyable, the <b>train ride</b> was a delight as well.&nbsp; 
  We were helped by the fact that we embarked at the end of the line, but Milano 
  Centrale was efficient, and we had climbed the learning curve.&nbsp; The 
  journey was  pure relaxation as we skirted the foothills of the Italian Alps and 
  crossed the Veneto Plain, alongside Lake Garda and through stops at Brescia, 
  Verona, Vicenza, Padova, and Venezia Mestre on our way to <b>Stazione Venezia 
  Santa Lucia</b>.&nbsp; Crossing the Venetian Causeway was like entering someone 
  else's dream.</li>

  <li>We arrived in Venice in good order and immediately made for the vaporetto 
  (the waterbus that one uses to travel around the city) and traveled half the 
  length of the <u><b>Canal Grande (Grand Canal)</b></u> to the <u><b>
  Ponte Rialto (Rialto Bridge)</b></u> stop near our hotel.&nbsp; (N.B.:&nbsp; 
  Although one generally, and properly, refers to riding the waterbus system as 
  &quot;taking a vaporetto&quot; no matter what type of boat one boards, precision demands 
  awareness that &quot;vaporetto&quot; is the word for one of three very distinct types of 
  boats that comprise this system, the other two being the motoscafo and the 
  motonave.)</li>

  <li>The <b>Locanda ai Bareteri</b> 
  is extremely well located, 
  halfway between the Ponte Rialto and Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square); it is a great hotel (with  real 
  human-sized bathrooms we were pleased to find).&nbsp; 
  I could have jumped, blindfolded and drunk, to the balcony across the street – 
  but that's the charm of Venice.&nbsp; Our room at the top of the hotel was a 
  ninety-one-step climb from the street, and  worth every huff.&nbsp; 
  Interestingly, the 
  hotel considered our room at the top of this five-story climb to be on the fourth floor of the 
  establishment:&nbsp; The entrance level was floor zero in Italy, of course – 
  but floor zero here was one flight up from the street.</li>

  <li>We had dinner at a nice pizzaria overlooking the Canal Grande at the foot 
  of the <u><b>Ponte Accademia (Accademia Bridge)</b></u>; then we returned to 
  our hotel for the evening.&nbsp; After the charcoal overcoat of Rome, the 
  sepia tones of Florence, and the gray stone of Milan, the vibrant colors of 
  Venice were stunning, and so much more welcome than if we had taken these 
  cities in reverse order.</li>
