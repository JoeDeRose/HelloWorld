<h2 align="center">Trip to Italy<br>
September 9-25, 2003</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li>If the trip was not perfect, it was at least ideal:&nbsp; We all enjoyed the 
sights and each other's company, the time spent in each city allowed us to see 
our full itinerary without rushing and without getting bored, we enjoyed 
beautiful weather and delicious food, and trip plans went without a hitch.</li>
  <li>None of the caveats that were issued regarding Italy seemed accurate to me:&nbsp; Everything was efficiently handled exactly on schedule (I could set my watch by 
the Italian trains); no one made any move (that we could discern at least) to 
deceive us or steal from us; while there were some beggars, no gypsy children 
(or anyone) reached in our pockets – the beggars were all, in fact, adults; we 
were never, so far as I know, shortchanged (and, indeed, I miscalculated on 
a couple of occasions the change to expect and was surprised to receive more 
than I anticipated); driving was orderly, and while some Italian drivers are 
aggressive, others are as timid and slow as we have at home; crossing the 
streets in Rome and other large cities was not a matter of skill and courage, 
but was governed by crossing signals and pedestrian right-of-ways that were 
largely obeyed by people on the sidewalk and vehicles in the street.</li>
  <li>I went through six sets of camera batteries.</li>
