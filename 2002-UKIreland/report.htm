<p>Having left Atlanta the previous evening, we arrived in London early, went
through customs, and made our way into town on the <a href="http://www.gatwickexpress.co.uk/"><b>Gatwick
Express</b></a> train.&nbsp; We checked in at our hotel just in time for lunch, which
we ate (a bit guiltily) at Burger King so that we would not lose too much more
of the already short day.</p>

            get to.&nbsp; Then we set to climbing back down to the street.<br>

<p><a href="MillenniumBridge.jpg">
<img border="1" src="MillenniumBridge200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150"></a>After
departing St. Paul's, we crossed the <b>Millennium Bridge</b> – a new type of
suspension bridge design in which the suspension &quot;towers&quot; rise barely
higher than the level of the bridge itself;&nbsp; it was originally opened as part of London's
millennium celebration, and only recently reopened after some
&quot;wobbling&quot; problems had been addressed.&nbsp; Just on the south bank of the Thames, by the
Millennium Bridge, we briefly passed through the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/default.htm"><b>Tate
Modern</b></a>; we didn't take time to see any of the exhibitions, but I had
been quite keen on seeing the physical plant, as this building is known
internationally for the successful conversion of an old electric plant into an art
museum.&nbsp; Notably, its Turbine Gallery, literally where the turbines once
were placed, allows for huge works of art that simply cannot be displayed in
most other museums.&nbsp; We walked through the building and briefly surveyed
the current installation in the Turbine Gallery, and then took our first
white-knuckle taxi ride to the <a href="http://www.thedungeons.com/"><b> London
Dungeon</b></a>.</p>
<p>Billy
had done the research on which of the &quot;spooky&quot; sites to visit – the
London Dungeon or Madame Tussaud's – and had decided that the London Dungeon
would be the one.&nbsp; It is essentially a guided tour through the more gruesome
history of London, from the plagues to the tortures to the executions, with
large areas dedicated to telling the stories of the great London Fire and the
saga of Jack-the-Ripper.&nbsp; It was educational and entertaining; we gave it
high marks.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="LondonTube1.jpg" width="550" height="174"></p>
<p>After a quick return to the hotel via the London Underground (London Bridge
Station to Victoria Station), we taxied to the <b><a href="http://www.british-airways.com/londoneye/">
British Airways London Eye</a></b>, a huge Ferris-wheel type device that sits literally
in the Thames River.&nbsp; Its enclosed capsules carry tourists through the 450-foot
circle over the course of a half-hour, and is well worth the time and
expense.&nbsp; <i>It was from the London Eye that I framed the best picture I
never got:&nbsp; Nearing the top of the circuit, which we began at sunset, I
spotted St. Paul's Cathedral gleaming white like a gemstone against the dimly
lit surrounding neighborhood.&nbsp; Its spires and its dome genuinely glistened
under the heavy spotlights, and from this height, the entire building was
visible – an impossible view from the ground.&nbsp; Instead of this shot, I got a message on my screen reading,
&quot;Check Your Batteries.&quot;&nbsp; Use your imagination.</i></p>
<p>After the London Eye, we hopped another taxi to the <b><a href="http://www.medievalbanquet.com/html/frames.htm"> Medieval Banquet</a></b> – a
tourist show that I remembered from my previous visit to London with my mother,
more that 20 years earlier.&nbsp; The Medieval Banquet is a bit hokey, but
fun:&nbsp; A four-course all-you-can-eat meal is served amid
&quot;Medieval&quot; entertainment – sword fights, sorcery, and
strongmen.&nbsp; After the meal, we took the Tube from Tower Hill Station back to Victoria
Station finally to
get some much-needed sleep.</p>

<h3 align="center"><b>Sunday, March 3, 2002</b></h3>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="RouteMarch03.gif" width="250" height="142"></p>
<p><img border="1" src="DriveOnTheLeft200.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="150">We got a later
start than we wished getting out of London, but quickly made our way to the
Gatwick Express for a return trip to the airport.&nbsp; There we picked up the
rental car and I got my first taste of driving on the left.&nbsp; It was far
more disorienting than I had expected:&nbsp; Staying on the left side of the road was no
problem (especially since my first hour-and-a-half were on a motorway).&nbsp;
And even shifting gears with my left hand wasn't too difficult.&nbsp; But sitting on the right side of the car was unexpectedly
confusing:&nbsp; It
wasn't just a matter of walking to the wrong door each time we returned to the
car (an error
that for some reason never plagued Billy).&nbsp; Rather, I found it complicated
to center the car in the lane, and had my left wheels hanging off the edge a lot
of the time at first.&nbsp; (This error did indeed plague Billy just a much,
when he finally drove!)&nbsp; I had been driving for half a week before the
first time that I reached in the correct direction to buckle my seat belt.&nbsp; And
on the few occasions that I actually looked in the proper place for my rear-view
mirror, I found that I could not get nearly the sense of traffic flow behind me
that I would be able to get back home.&nbsp; Entering a parking space (or any
one-lane area) was a nail-biting experience at first.&nbsp; And I don't think I
ever actually backed out of a parking space onto the correct side of the
road.&nbsp; By the end of the trip, though, I was a pro:&nbsp; zipping along
narrow mountain roads in the rain, passing the lorries at the merest hint of a
straightaway, parallel parking in Dublin, and even dealing with those ubiquitous
but absurd &quot;Oncoming Traffic in Center of Roadway&quot; signs.&nbsp; The
picture to the right is actually from Scotland.&nbsp; Perplexingly, we saw no
such sign in England, where most people get their first taste of driving on the
left – but a ton of them in Scotland, by which point we thought that most
people would be accustomed to the system (or hospitalized).</p>
<p><a href="Stonehenge.htm">
<img border="1" src="StonehengeClose200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150"></a>We made it to <b><a href="http://www.stonehenge.co.uk/Stonehenge/stonehenge.htm">Stonehenge</a></b>
as expected, however, and immediately set about seeing the ancient
monument.&nbsp; I was captivated by the Ravens atop the stones, and tried to get
some pictures that highlighted what seemed to me a very poetic juxtaposition –
the delicate and dark birds drawn to land on the heavy and severe, yet bright
and skyward-reaching, monolith.&nbsp; <font size="2"><b>(Click on the picture for a full set of our
pictures from Stonehenge.)</b></font></p>
<p>After leaving Stonehenge, we went north to <b><a href="http://www.stonehenge.co.uk/avebury/avebury.htm">Avebury</a></b>,
another stone circle significantly larger than its more famous cousin.&nbsp; The stones
themselves here are much larger than at Stonehenge, and the circle is vast
enough to encircle part of the town in which it is set.&nbsp; Billy was
exhausted from taking Benadryl for an allergic reaction, and had trouble fighting
the drowsiness at this stop – so we couldn't give Avebury the attention it
deserved.&nbsp; Fortunately, we were able to return here on the last day to take
pictures and explore it more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Because of our late start in the morning, it was well into the afternoon by
the time we left Avebury.&nbsp; Not wanting to let it get dark on a challenging
route on my first driving-on-the-left day, we decided to skip the Uffington
White Horse and Ironbridge, and instead head directly to the motorway to reach
Newcastle-upon-Tyne in a timely fashion.&nbsp; It was on this drive that I first
learned the limitations of asking directions of the insular English:&nbsp;
Without exception, if I asked directions to a town any farther than the closest
village on a major road, I would be met with the reply, &quot;I've never heard
of it; can you tell me the name of a town on the way?&quot;&nbsp; I left
convinced that if I had asked the directions to London, I would hear back the
identical response.&nbsp; Perhaps I just had bad luck with the people that I asked
for directions – but I quickly found myself wondering how it was possible that
England had given birth to so many explorers.</p>
<p>While we regretted having to skip some of the stops on our itinerary, the
beauty of this drive was a nice compensation:&nbsp; Before night fell, we had
the chance to drive through one quaint English village after another, marveling
at the thatched roofs and the stone walls and the monumental churches and clock towers
that dominated village squares.&nbsp; Night fell as we reached the motorway, and
then we simply enjoyed the rolling hills of north England, which looked as if a
blanket of Christmas lights had been gently draped upon them.</p>
<p>We certainly could have made it to Newcastle-upon-Tyne at a reasonable hour,
but were panicked by a service area attendant who told us (inaccurately, we now
know) that we should not expect to find a hotel room without a reservation, and
that hotels might not be prepared to receive guests in the late evening.&nbsp;
With this warning, we made a reservation for a motorway TraveLodge in Scotch
Corner, an hour shy of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Monday, March 4, 2002</b></h3>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="RouteMarch04.gif" width="250" height="142"></p>
<p>Spending the night in Scotch Corner actually left us better positioned for
seeing Hadrian's Wall early on this leg.&nbsp; We had to skip the Gateshead
Millennium Bridge – but that stop had really just been an afterthought, added
because we anticipated spending the night very near it.</p>
<p><a href="HadriansWall.htm">
<img border="1" src="HadriansWallRemnant200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="71"></a>I
was still wrapping my mind around the signposting of the British routes, and found the signage
almost impenetrable at this point.&nbsp; But in moving
north, we eventually came to signs for <b><a href="http://www.hadrians-wall.org/">Hadrian's
Wall</a></b>, and followed them religiously.&nbsp; These led us to Chesters
Roman Fort, at which we thought we were just asking directions, so we didn't
take the camera – a decision that later filled us with regret, as it turned out
that Chesters was easily the most spectacular part of the wall that we
saw.&nbsp; It included
a museum of Third Century Roman carvings and inscriptions as well as impressive
sections of the Fort that had somehow survived the ages.&nbsp; We did get out at
Carrawburgh (pronounced &quot;CARE-a-berf&quot;) and took a couple of pictures of wall segments that we saw.&nbsp;
<font size="2"><b>(Click on the image to see these.)</b></font></p>
<p><img border="1" src="ScotlandBorder.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="153">Shortly after leaving
Hadrian's Wall, we entered Scotland, and briefly paused for pictures at the
border overlook.&nbsp; We were happy to find ourselves posing beside the same marker
that my mother had posed beside on her visit
a few years ago.</p>
<p><a href="JedburghAbbey.htm">
<img border="1" src="JedburghAbbeyVertical200.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="200"></a>We
looked for lunch in Jedburgh and there stumbled upon the spectacular <b><a href="http://www.injedburgh.freeserve.co.uk/abbey.htm">Jedburgh
Abbey</a></b>.&nbsp; We hadn't even realized that this spectacular ruin existed
before pulling into the town hungry for a meal.&nbsp; And in the shadow of
Jedburgh Abbey, we enjoyed – indeed, enjoyed very much – our first fish and
chips of the trip.&nbsp; According to the information I have been able to find
upon our return, this incredible building has lay unused now for over 850 years
– in ruins for as long as there has been a written history on my continent!&nbsp;
<font size="2"><b>(Click on the image for a the two pictures I took of the abbey.)</b></font></p>
<p>Moving north we bypassed Edinburgh, and crossed the Firth of Forth on the
Forth Road Bridge, which runs alongside, and afforded us a spectacular view of, the famous <b><a href="http://www.forthbridges.org.uk/">Forth
Rail Bridge</a></b>.&nbsp; The rail bridge would be a amazing feat of
engineering even today, and is particularly phenomenal in that it was constructed over a
century ago.</p>
<p><a href="CastleStuart.htm">
<img border="1" src="CastleStuartFireplace200.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="150"></a>We spent the
night at <b><a href="http://www.castlestuart.com/">Castle Stuart</a></b> near
Inverness, a magnificent building that had been left alone with its ghosts as a
ruin for 300 years, from shortly after its construction to the recent renovation
to Jacobean elegance at the loving hands of the Stuart family.&nbsp; We stayed
here in the &quot;Stuart of Appin&quot; room overlooking the Moray Firth and
Inverness, and enjoyed exploring the castle's
beautiful rooms and secret passages, of which Caroline Stuart showed us
many.&nbsp; At Castle Stuart we had two of the best meals of our trip.&nbsp; The
first of these meals was the enormous dinner at which we both tried for the first time (and
liked) haggis.&nbsp; We knew in general how haggis is made, but couldn't
remember the specific set of icky organs that goes into it (sheep's heart,
liver, and kidney, boiled in the stomach), and so, when the chef came out to
inquire how we had enjoyed our meal, we asked him what it was composed of.&nbsp;
He looked concerned that we might ask, shuffled his feet nervously, looked to
the floor, and then said (in a thick Scottish accent), &quot;It's just
offal.&quot;&nbsp; We misunderstood his pronunciation, and hilarious hijinks
ensued as we tried to reassure him.&nbsp; <b><font size="2">(Click on the image for more
pictures of Castle Stuart, including one of the secret passages.)</font></b></p>

<p> The next morning at Castle Stuart, we partook of a breakfast
even more generous than the dinner:&nbsp; Piled before us were fruit, toast,
porridge, cereal,
milk, juices, sausage, eggs, bacon, ham, and, for dessert (I had never even heard of a dessert course at breakfast!),
pancakes and waffles with fruit spread.&nbsp; The cook at Castle Stuart sent us on our way, noting that it was windy out
and she hoped the ferry wouldn't take her breakfast.&nbsp; As we would learn
several hours later, she was right to be
concerned.</p>
<p><a href="HighlandClearances.jpg">
<img border="1" src="HighlandClearances200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150"></a>As
soon as we left the castle, we drove north up the amazing Caithness and
Sutherland coast, which was a series of stone cliffs against the North
Sea.&nbsp; Here we were impressed by the slate fences that some farmers erected
between their fields – constructed simply from squares of&nbsp; slate, set between posts to keep them upright.&nbsp; We also saw ruined homes that
we later learned were vestiges of the &quot;Highland Clearances,&quot; a
disreputable period of Scottish History in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries in which clan chiefs burned people out of their homes, and forced them
out of Scotland, to turn their land into more profitable sheep farms.</p>
<p><a href="DunnetHead.jpg">
<img border="1" src="DunnetHead200.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="131"></a>We
arrived in Scrabster (the town is about as pretty as its name) exactly on
schedule, patting ourselves on the back for the precision of our
itinerary.&nbsp; Then we waited for the late ferry to arrive.&nbsp; At about the
time we should have been disembarking in Orkney, the St. Ola finally set
sail.&nbsp; The first part of the crossing was particularly rough and rainy, but
we did enjoy passing the lighthouse atop the magnificent cliffs of Dunnet Head,
the northernmost point of the island of Great Britain.&nbsp; <font size="2"><b>(Click
on the picture for a more spectacular view of the cliff.)</b></font>&nbsp; Instead of its
normal route along the western edge of the archipelago, the ferry sought calmer
waters by going between the islands, through the bay known as the Scapa
Flow.&nbsp; It was a successful strategy:&nbsp; For the latter two-thirds of the
voyage we were plagued only with rain rather than rolling water.&nbsp; We were
really lucky that we tackled the ferry crossings in the order we did, as the
boats got progressively better.&nbsp; It was painful enough as we did it; to
have gone in the reverse order would have been excruciating.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Stromness.jpg" width="800" height="164"><br>
<font size="2"><b>Stromness</b></font></p>
<p><a href="Orkney.htm"><img border="1" src="Stenness1-200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150"></a>The ferry arrived in
picturesque Stromness at about 4:30 in the afternoon – almost three hours
late, and after closing time for two of the places we had really hoped to see
– Maes Howe (a Neolithic tomb with the largest collection of runic
graffiti outside Scandinavia) and Scara Brae (an excavated stone-age
town).&nbsp; This was the only day of our trip in which rain proved a problem,
but it was <i> quite</i> a problem in Orkney.&nbsp; I found myself thinking that if this
wasn't a hundred-year flood of some sort, that the Orcadians really should seek
higher ground.&nbsp; We also found in Orkney – perhaps because it is both
small and remote – that all pretext of adequate signage had been
abandoned.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we did get to see the spectacular <b>Standing
Stones of Stenness</b> and the <b>Ring of Brodgar</b> (marked there as the
&quot;Ring of Brogar&quot;).&nbsp; <font size="2"><b>(Click on the picture for more pictures of
Orkney stones.)</b></font></p>
<p>We then explored much of the rest of the mainland (which is what the unnamed
primary island of Orkney is called), and crossed the shockingly narrow Churchill
Causeways to a couple of other islands, Burray and South Ronaldsay, in search of
the Italian Chapel.&nbsp; We found the chapel after it had closed, but
nonetheless enjoyed the drive, and especially the amazing shipwrecks we saw from
the Churchill Causeways.&nbsp; We had heard that the waters of Orkney are among
the most dangerous in the world, and it was certainly easy to see confirmation
of this as we drove around:&nbsp; here a crow's nest askew in the water, there
an upturned hull, and jagged pieces of metal rising from the water all around.</p>
<p>At the Kirkwall Hotel we had a fine meal (haggis again for me; Billy had
fish) and stayed the night.&nbsp; The Kirkwall Hotel is dignified and quaint in
all the ways one might want a hotel in the biggest city of a remote place to be
dignified and quaint.&nbsp; It still had the old lift doors that one had to open
manually; it was obvious what portion of the room had been carved out to allow
for en suite facilities; and the phones, like all that we found in Orkney, were
not designed for tone dialing.&nbsp; In uncharitable moments we found ourselves
wondering if the staff of the Kirkwall might consider <i>1900 House</i> science
fiction – but it kept us warm and dry on a cold and rainy night, and now that I'm back home, I think it was my favorite stop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Wednesday, March 6, 2002</b></h3>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="RouteMarch06.gif" width="250" height="142"></p>
<p><a href="ItalianChapel.jpg">
<img border="1" src="ItalianChapel200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150"></a>We
left the Kirkwall Hotel early, and made a quick detour by the <b>Italian Chapel</b>
to see it in more detail, and, we hoped, view the interior.&nbsp; The chapel is
a remnant of the use of its small island as a place for Italian prisoners of war
(before the construction of the roadway that connected it to several other
islands).&nbsp; These prisoners used refuse and spare parts to transform one of
their Quonset huts into the type of chapel that they remembered from home.&nbsp;
It was supposed to open at dawn every day – but we were there well after
sunrise and it remained locked down.&nbsp; We got a good look at the exterior
though.</p>
<p>After visiting the Italian Chapel, we hurried back to Stromness and the St.
Ola to &quot;go south&quot; (as the Orcadians say when they're leaving
Orkney).&nbsp; We had considered staying in Orkney longer to see the sites that
we had missed the previous day – but decided that we didn't want to throw the
rest of the trip off schedule.&nbsp; The harsh ferry ride from the previous day was a picnic compared
to this one:&nbsp; The St. Ola resumed its normal route west of Orkney, which
afforded us a much-desired view of the <b>Old Man of Hoy</b>, a towering stone
column on the northwest coast of the island of Hoy, but also exposed us to the
whimsy of the rambunctious north Atlantic.&nbsp; For three hours we would look
out the windows and see nothing but water, then nothing but sky, then nothing
but water again.&nbsp; And constantly there was the scraaaaaaaaaaaape - clank! -
scraaaaaaaaaaaape - clank! of some metal implement loose in its housing.&nbsp;
At times the aft or stern of the St. Ola would crash down upon the water,
sending a mighty splash to the sea birds that surrounded us.&nbsp; And even the crew
– seasoned veterans of this sort of crossing, one assumes – were having
trouble walking on the voyage, and all through the trip we watched as our
shipmates stumbled helplessly into walls and each other.&nbsp; To compound
the challenge to my stomach, I had decided to stop at the snack bar as the ship
got underway to sample the black pudding – blood
(blood <i>substitute</i>, they assured me) and oatmeal as best I could tell.&nbsp; Billy and I both confessed to
each other afterward that we had spent a sizeable portion of the trip
familiarizing ourselves with the location of the life vest closets and
lifeboats.</p>
<p><a href="UrquartCastle.jpg">

on blessed terra firma, we continued southward toward Drumnadrochit, where we
toured the <b>Loch Ness 2000 Exhibition</b>.&nbsp; We had expected a hucksterish
promulgation of the myth, and were surprised when this multimedia presentation
emphasized the science that all but disproves the Loch Ness Monster
stories.&nbsp; It did give an excellent history of the search for Nessie, and
extolled the grandeur of the environment.&nbsp; Notable among the things we
learned was that Loch Ness is the largest
body of water in Great Britain, and holds a greater volume than every river,
pond, and lake in England and Wales combined.</p>
<p>We continued south by <b>Urquart Castle</b> (pronounced &quot;ER-kert&quot;), which overlooks the widest part
of Loch Ness.&nbsp; It was getting dark at we approached Fort William, but we
enjoyed the scenery while we could, especially the beautiful cliffs that rose
straight up from the car on one side, and plummeted to the shore on the other,
as well as the amazing view of the mountains rising up from the mists of Loch Lochy.&nbsp; After dinner, I
was glad to have several days of British driving under my belt, as I faced the
most challenging portions of the route I had yet seen:&nbsp; first the rainy,
dark roads along Loch Lomond, and then the urban driving as we passed through
Glasgow.</p>

<p>We left our hotel in Kilmarnock early, and made our way to Stranraer for the
ferry crossing to Belfast.&nbsp; If every crossing were as easy as this one, I
wouldn't be cursing ferries today:&nbsp; The drive was pleasant and
relaxed as we descended the coast of Scotland and enjoyed still more spectacular
cliffs and mountains, and especially tiny Ailsa Craig rising distant in the water.&nbsp;
Then when we reached Loch Ryan, the bay at the bottom of which Stranraer rests,
we saw our ferry and paced it as we both approached the port – both of us on
time.&nbsp; In Stranraer we went through a bit of scrutiny, perhaps because of
the political situation in Northern Ireland, and then boarded the luxurious
European Causeway, which took us perfectly on schedule across the North Channel to Belfast.</p>
<p>The approach to Belfast is nothing but surreal.&nbsp; The city and its port
sit deep in Belfast Lough, and can only safely be approached between a long
straight row of buoys that lead one in turn past the breakwater, then past a split
in the waterway from one to three channels, then to
an industrial dockland with huge cranes that looked like giant horses and
enormous birds (which dockland we later learned was where the Titanic was
built).&nbsp; The tedious entry to Belfast reminded me of nothing so much as the
processional at the end of <i>Star Wars: Episode 4</i>, if <i>
Star Wars</i> had been set in a 60s Pittsburgh steel mill.</p>

seemed instantly dispiriting, and we immediately vacated it for Giants
Causeway.&nbsp; We had hoped that on the way we would visit the Carrick-a-Rede
rope bridge, but it had been removed in its entirety for some sort of
maintenance.&nbsp; We did, however, get the pleasant surprise of discovering the
ruins of <b> Dunseverick Castle</b> (at left) just before we arrived, and of <b> Dunluce
Castle</b> (at right) just after we departed.</p>

<p>When we finally reached <b><a href="http://www.giantscausewayofficialguide.com/">Giants Causeway</a></b>, we were both
captivated.&nbsp; It seemed inconceivable that these acres of hexagonal paving
stones – so they appeared to be – were a natural basalt formation.&nbsp; But
apparently so they are.&nbsp; Billy actually outlasted me as he ran from one
section of the formation – Ireland's first World Heritage Site – to
another.&nbsp; He even suggested we walk the seven-mile trail, although I talked
him out of it.&nbsp; <font size="2"><b>(Click on the picture for our set of Giants

<p>After leaving County Antrim, we drove south to the Irish border (where, to
our amusement, we noticed that they sold fireworks on the Northern Ireland
side), and were surprised to find
no notice at all of the change in jurisdiction – no border station, no
&quot;Welcome to Ireland&quot; sign, nothing but a slight change in how the lane
markings were painted.&nbsp; We had a
quick supper in a pub in Drogheda (pronounced &quot;DRO-uh-duh&quot;), and then continued to Dublin.&nbsp; I had
enjoyed familiarizing myself with the Pounds and Pence in the U.K., and I
especially enjoyed getting my first glimpse of the brand-new Euro in Ireland,
which had replaced the Punt just two months earlier.&nbsp; The novelty of the
Euro was especially evident every time someone would open a till, whereupon the
glare from the piles of shiny new coins was almost blinding.</p>
<p>Nothing could have prepared me for driving in Dublin.&nbsp; And, indeed,
nothing did.&nbsp; It was only through dumb luck that I stumbled to the city
center and found one of the hotels on my list.&nbsp; It couldn't accommodate us
for the two nights we would be in Dublin, but the staff helped me find a room at
the Trinity Capital, near the Temple Bar shopping district and across the street
from Trinity College.&nbsp; It was a superb place to spend the two nights, all
the more enthusiastically received amid of my dread at spending any more time
behind the wheel in the Irish capital.&nbsp; I did have to maneuver my way to a
parking garage in the Temple Bar, but the currents and eddies of the Dublin
traffic pushed me downstream in just the right direction:&nbsp; I found it on
the first try, and was even able to walk back to the hotel without undue
confusion.</p>

<p><a href="Newgrange.htm"><img border="1" src="Newgrange200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150"></a>We
spent the first part of our one full day in Ireland traveling up to <b><a href="http://www.missgien.net/neolithics/newgrange.html">Newgrange</a></b>
(or Brú na Bóinne) to see the magnificent Neolithic tomb.&nbsp; It predates
Stonehenge and is, indeed, one of the oldest constructions in Great Britain and
Ireland.&nbsp; We weren't permitted to take pictures inside the tomb, but we
could get shots of the exterior.&nbsp; <font size="2"><b>(Click on the image for our Newgrange pictures.)</b></font></p>
<p>The trip to Newgrange made it impossible for us to see Blarney Castle.&nbsp;
This was a bit of a disappointment, but we certainly appreciated having time to
relax at this point in the trip.</p>
<p>After returning to Dublin (and putting the car safely away), we walked over
to the Temple Bar district and looked for souvenirs.&nbsp; We found very little
that could be described as neither &quot;outrageously expensive&quot; nor
&quot;embarrassingly tacky,&quot; but the excursion was fun, and Billy did find a
ring that he liked, with a design reminiscent of the Newgrange spirals.&nbsp; As
we shivered our way from one shop to the next, the proprietors kept telling us
how balmy and pleasant the weather was that day.</p>

<p> &quot;Balmy and pleasant&quot; though the weather may have been that day, we
certainly got a healthy exposure to the capriciousness of Ireland's climate the
next morning as we prepared to leave, though
I'm happy to say that the same dumb luck that got us into Dublin eventually got
us out.&nbsp; We had not set an alarm that morning, certain that we had time to
catch the noon ferry from Dun Laoghaire (pronounced &quot;dun leery&quot;;
Gaelic spelling provides merely a hint as to the pronunciation).&nbsp; I got
bored waiting for Billy to finish his shower, so on a lark I called the ferry
confirmation line and was notified that snow in Dublin and rough water in the
Irish Sea had caused our crossing to be cancelled, and a later crossing to be in
doubt.&nbsp; The recording mentioned that passengers with reservations on the
noon sailing would be accommodated on a 9:30 AM sailing of a different boat from
Dublin Port.&nbsp; It was 8:20 when I heard this, and we still had to pack,
check out, retrieve the car, and get through Dublin to the port ... in the
snow!&nbsp; And Billy was still in the shower!</p>
<p>By some miracle we made it to Dublin Port in time – but as of our arrival,
Stena Line had cancelled even that one remaining crossing.&nbsp; However, the
drenched attendant at the entry alerted us that Irish Ferries was still taking
passengers for a 9:30 sailing.&nbsp; We promptly got in the wrong line, then
corrected ourselves, parked, bought tickets, returned to the car, made our way
to the now-empty queue without regard to lane markings or traffic laws, and
drove into the hold of the Ulysses with only one car behind us before the
massive doors closed shut.&nbsp; Even the stormy seas ahead were not enough to
dissuade us from a feeling of tremendous good fortune.&nbsp; As it turned out,
however, the Ulysses was a massive and stable ship:&nbsp; It barely wobbled as
we made our crossing to Holyhead.&nbsp; We wondered what the people who
considered this a perilous crossing would have thought of the journey to and
from Orkney.</p>

<p><a href="Conwy.jpg"><img border="1" src="Conwy200.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="150"></a>When
we reached Wales just after lunch, we found ourselves exactly on schedule:&nbsp;
The ferry had taken longer than we planned, but had left earlier.&nbsp; We drove
down the island of Anglesey, stopping quickly to photograph the train station
sign in <a href="http://www.anglesey-history.co.uk/"><b>Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch</b></a>,
the town with the longest name in Wales.&nbsp; (It translates to English as,
&quot;The church of St. Mary in a hollow of white hazel near a rapid whirlpool
and near St. Tysilio's church by the red cave.&quot;)&nbsp; <font size="2"><b>(Click on the image
to see the train station on which the sign is placed.)&nbsp; </b></font>Upon crossing to the mainland
– or, more accurately, the much larger island of Great Britain – we followed the
beautiful north Wales coast to <b><a href="http://www.castlewales.com/conwy.html">Castle Conwy</a></b>.&nbsp; We poked around Conwy
a bit to see the castle from all angles, and to enjoy seeing the walled town,
and then headed south through <b>Snowdonia</b>.</p>
<p>Snowdonia, the mountainous national park surrounding Snowdon (the highest
peak in England and Wales) is an indescribably beautiful region – easily, in
my opinion, the most beautiful place we saw on a trip filled with beautiful
places.&nbsp; Water and stone dominated the environment:&nbsp; At one point we
came upon a waterfall plummeting from a cliff on the side of the roadway,
literally into a well that had been hollowed from the road – hazardous, but
picturesque.&nbsp; Then we came upon an immense wall literally bridging between
two mountains, which we could only assume to be an aqueduct, its face of stone
broken only with arches to allow our roadway to cross through, and to allow a
river beside us to pass under it.&nbsp; Farther along, we came to mountains of
slate, covered hundreds of feet high with black slate rocks.</p>
<p><a href="PentreIfan.jpg">
<img border="1" src="PentreIfan200.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150"></a>We
were struggling to get to the south of Wales in time to see <b><a href="http://www.stonepages.com/wales/pentreifan.html"> Pentre Ifan</a></b>
(pronounced &quot;PEN-tray EE-van&quot;) by
daylight.&nbsp; This proved impossible, but we did get to see the massive dolmen,
or tomb, by the light of the moon.&nbsp; It was too cold and dark really to
enjoy it as much as we might have, but I did get to touch the stones and to stand
underneath the giant top stone.</p>
<p>After Pentre Ifan, we made haste for the motorway to get as far east as
possible, in preparation for our flight home the next day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had but a little time to spend before making our way to Gatwick, but
decided to spend this time returning to Avebury, which we had not seen as much
as we wanted on our first day out of London.&nbsp; It was interesting to drive
the very same roads that I had found so unnerving just a week earlier, now
feeling quite comfortable with driving on the left.</p>

<b>Avebury</b>, we walked around the circle just to take in the scope of the
place.&nbsp; The stones themselves are gargantuan (at left), the circle is immense, and
all of this is dwarfed by the pit that surrounds the structure (at right).&nbsp; We
explored here until we felt content, and then went to Gatwick to return the car
and wait for our flight.</p>

<h3 align="center">Advice</h3>

<p align="left">People don't ask for my advice nearly as often as I wish they
would.&nbsp; Nonetheless, here are a few things I picked up that took me by
surprise.&nbsp; Perhaps reading of them here will help someone else plan more
effectively.</p>
<ol>
  <li>There is no yellow center line in the United Kingdom:&nbsp; The center
    line is white, just like the lines separating the lanes.&nbsp; Indeed, the center line
    in areas where&nbsp; passing is permitted is often no
    different than the line between lanes going in the same
    direction.&nbsp; In such a circumstance, one must rely on memory, and occasional arrows, to keep in
    the right place.</li>
  <li>A curved arrow in your lane pointing opposite your direction of travel and
    curving toward the center line is <i> not</i> cause for concern; it is merely a
    warning to vehicles passing in the other direction to vacate your lane
    before some impediment, such as a sharp curve or the top of a hill.&nbsp; The
    symbol may be in the center of the passing lane (your lane) or it may be
    superimposed on the center line.&nbsp; (A <i>straight</i> line pointing opposite your
    direction of travel <i>does</i>, however, indicate you are going the wrong
    way.)</li>
  <li> You won't have time to
    figure things out once the car is moving; plan the
    route when stopped for gas/snacks/sightseeing, or use layabouts (parking areas).&nbsp;
    Roundabouts are (usually) convenient for keeping traffic moving, but allow
    no time for figuring out the route.&nbsp; There are virtually no stop signs in the
    U.K. – we drove the length and
    breadth of Great Britain, and much of Northern Ireland, and saw only three
    – and there are few traffic lights.</li>
  <li>Some roundabouts have two-way traffic flow in them.&nbsp; One that we
    experienced like this, the &quot;<a href="http://www.swindonweb.com/life/lifemagi0.htm"><b>Magic Roundabout</b></a>&quot; in Swindon, was one
    large roundabout with five separate roundabouts at its exit points.</li>
  <li>U.K. routes are numbered, but have no direction (north, south, east,
    west); thus it is easy to find yourself
    pointing in the wrong direction even when you have found the proper
    route.&nbsp; Always know the next few cities through which you will pass to follow the route
    successfully.</li>
  <li>Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland have separate bank notes, which may not be
    accepted in England &amp; Wales; Bank of England notes are accepted
    everywhere in the U.K.&nbsp; Scottish notes are printed by the Bank of
    Scotland.&nbsp; Northern Irish notes are printed by various banks, and there
    is quite a lot of diversity among them.</li>
  <li>Street signs in Dublin are not on posts at the intersection; rather, the
    street name is
    mounted on a building at the intersection, usually just above the ground
    floor.</li>
  <li>Due to the unpredictability of weather, ferries cannot be expected to run
    uninterrupted on published schedules; be aware of weather forecasts and
    check schedule update information.&nbsp; Passengers with booking on cancelled
    sailings may be accommodated on <i>earlier</i> sailings, so be prepared for this
    contingency.&nbsp; (As for myself, I would not again plan a trip that depended on use of ferries.)</li>
